Box's book series of the same name.</h2><p>Premiering on Dec. 6, 2021, the 10-part Joe Pickett series (which may compete with Paramount Network's neo-western series <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>) is an adaptation of New York Times bestselling author Charles James Box's series of novels. He's written several stand-alone novels (like Shots Fired) and short stories, but he's well known for his Joe Pickett crime novels. Starting with Open Season and (thus far) ending with the upcoming 2022 entry, Shadows Reel, there are 22 books in the Joe Pickett series.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though the 22 novels are connected, C.J. explained that you don't necessarily have to start with the first book, published in 2001. "In their way each book stands alone," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Penguin Random House</a> in an interview.</p><p>"No reader would be hopelessly lost starting with any book in the series. Of course, those who’ve read them all say it’s important to start with Open Season so the reader can experience Joe’s family growing and changing, and I probably lean that direction. But there are certain books — Winterkill, Free Fire, Breaking Point, and Off the Grid — that I think could be good entry points into the series," C.J. continued.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Considering the western-style premise of the Joe Pickett series, it's not too surprising to learn that C.J. Box himself lives on a ranch in Wyoming with his wife, Laurie. Often seen donning a beige cowboy hat and a pair of blue jeans, C.J. "has worked as a ranch hand, surveyor, fishing guide, a small town newspaper reporter and editor, and he owned an international tourism marketing firm with his wife," as stated on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p><p>The upcoming Spectrum original also stars David Alan Grier (In Living Color), Julianna Guill (Friday the 13th), Sharon Lawrence (NYPD Blue), and Ben Hollingsworth (Virgin River), among others.</p><p>The first three episodes of Joe Pickett premiere on Dec. 6, 2021, on Spectrum.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6q7vEZqeim5uawbV50p6pop2jYq%2Biv8SdZKim</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rebecca-beale-20021203-html.html><span>←</span><span>Rebecca Beale (Chef) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
