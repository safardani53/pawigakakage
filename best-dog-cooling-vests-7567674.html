Dogs release and regulate their temperature through their mouths, nose, and paw pads, and they still need protection from the heat and sun like we do. A cooling vest is a great way to help them stay cool, especially if they’ll be doing outdoor exercise with you, like hiking or running.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We took to online retailers and scoured reviews by pet owners to put together a roundup of some of the best cooling vests on the market, whether you’ll be spending the summer camping, hanging by the pool, or exploring outside. It's important to note that sometimes it's just too hot and humid to do strenuous outdoor activities with your dog, and a cooling vest won't change that. Still, for everyday summertime fun, a cooling vest is a great way to ensure your dog stays comfortable.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-you-be-aware-of-before-you-buy-a-dog-cooling-vest></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What should you be aware of before you buy a dog cooling vest?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cooling vests can be an excellent tool in the summer months, but there are some things you should be aware of before you rely too much on them, according to Erin Askeland, MSc, CPDT-KA, CBCC-KA, an Animal Health and Behavior Expert for Camp Bow Wow. “Cooling vests may not be effective in extremely humid conditions where evaporation is limited,” she says, “If not used properly, cooling vests might [also] make the dog too cold, leading to shivering or discomfort.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">She also urges the importance of monitoring your dog’s behavior when they’re wearing a cooling vest; you are the one who truly knows what’s normal for them. If they show any discomfort or irritation, you should take the vest off and find another approach to keep them cool. And of course, cooling vests should not be a substitute for proper hydration or shade.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With this in mind, keep reading for the best dog cooling vests of 2024, according to pet owners.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-rantow-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rantow Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rantow Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/likHRC6Z9hWF94vXEP34hcbyyqA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/rantow--dog-cooling-vest-5f67a53255a0423ba8c788164ea448bf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love this cooling vest by Rantzow because it manages to be lightweight but effective. If your dog isn't used to wearing anything more than a collar, they’ll still be able to keep this on without feeling uncomfortable or fighting and chewing it off. All you have to do is soak it in water, wring out the excess, and put it on your dog.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What’s unique about this cooling vest is the fact that it is designed in layers — the inner most works to absorb the water you submerge it in, while the outermost has UV-resisting technology that repels heat and allows for slow evaporation that will keep your dog from feeling weighed down. Both of these features work in tandem to prolong the amount of time it stays damp and subsequently keeps your dog’s temperature regulated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Pet owners said they’re particularly impressed by how long this vest lasts — while many vests that work this way have the caveat of drying quickly, this one stays damp whether you’re on a neighborhood walk or a long hike. We also really appreciate the adjustable belly band for better sizing customization and the opening on the back for easy leash and collar access. These features come at a very reasonable price — even the largest size (XXXL!) is under $25. You truly cannot go wrong with this dog cooling vest if you’re not quite sure what you’re looking for besides something that's of good quality and affordable.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large, XX-Large, XXX-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-coppthinktu-breathable-cooling-jacket></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coppthinktu Breathable Cooling Jacket</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Coppthinktu Breathable Cooling Jacket" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ksmMI2ZZwAuMkgTEhdUaZPd2w1s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/coppthinktu--breathable-cooling-jacket--99b9a69707234f05b855b58047343b89.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This is a great option if you want a cooling vest that won’t break the bank, or you have a one-off outing where your dog will be exposed to hot temperatures and you want something that will give them relief.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although this cooling vest is lighter and on the cheaper side, it still does a great job of keeping your pet cool and comfortable. After getting it wet, some pet owners suggest putting it in the fridge for a few minutes to make its cooling properties last even longer, but it still stays relatively cool if you just get it damp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The soft, self-cooling fabric is also stretchy and moves with your dog, so they won’t be constricted if they’re in the backyard playing or jumping in the pool. If you want a cooling shirt that’s still affordable (all sizes are under $15) you and your dog will love this one.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Self-cooling fabric | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Medium, Large, X-Large, XX-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-ruffwear-swamp-cooler-zip-dog-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Zip Dog Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Zip Dog Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/8kqzShf-keYH03Ni3PxMBHm_Ib4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ruffwear-swamp-cooler-zip-dog-vest-evaporative-cooling-for-hot-weather-salmon-pink-medium-38f0dcbba3a94964aab8d49284bdee1f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are you worried about finding a cooling vest that will last for the long haul? This cooling zip vest by Ruffwear won our vote for best investment because it’s a great choice for those of you looking for something that you can get years of use out of. Its three layers work together to retain cooling effects, while also releasing heat from the outside. The innermost layer, which is made of mesh, keeps it breathable so that your dog doesn’t feel bogged down. The oversized armholes allow maximum mobility so your dog can run and play without interruption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing that really signals the high quality of this vest is the top-to-bottom zipper that allows for quickly taking it on and off. Pet owners love this vest for how long it stays damp and cool, and how easily it wicks off any mud or dirt that your furry friend will inevitably encounter in their adventures. Coming in at just under $60, this is a little more of a splurge — but if you are willing to spend, you’ll absolutely love it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Spandex/Nylon/Polyester Blend | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>XX-Small, X-Small, Small, Medium, Large, X-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-flying-tail-reflective-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FLYING TAIL Reflective Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="FLYING TAIL Reflective Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/3Oq4UMKlxMAhS9vvB_G7xdlh3BQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/flying-tail--reflective-dog-cooling-vest-ec04cb5c0fa946a3959837c073b1da13.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vest won our vote for best lightweight because it is equipped with a single cooling layer that will keep your dog comfortable without too much added weight. One thing we love about this vest is that it’s reversible — one side is a solid color, while the other side has an adorable star pattern that is revealed when it’s wet. As the water evaporates, the stars fade, which is an excellent way to track when you need to wet it again. This would be perfect for dogs who are primarily indoors but need something that will keep them cool on walks and bathroom breaks throughout the day.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Self-Cooling Fabric | <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>XX-Small, X-Small, Small,<strong> </strong>Medium, Large, X-Large, XX-Large, XXX-Large, XXXX-Large, XXXXX-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-thick-coats-joypaws-ice-cool-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Thick Coats</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>JOYPAWS Ice Cool Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="JOYPAWS Ice Cool Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0oRclb_l-oTZvkW-1OUsdDUVfyc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joypaws-ice-cool-dog-cooling-vest-evaporative-cooling-for-summer-and-hot-weather-adjustable-outdoor-dog-jacket-safety-reflective-vest-cooler-sun-proof--c9391f45ecd545d69fe3659699e73111.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cooling vests are especially helpful for dogs with thick coats that are already predisposed to struggling with heat regulation. Putting them in one during the summer months, especially if they’ll be going on long walks or playing outside, can help to keep them safe and comfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This one, like most other cooling vests on the market, is activated by submerging it in water — the innermost layer concentrates the coolness from the water while slowly allowing the water to evaporate and release the heat along with it. We love this cooling vest by JOYPAWS for dogs with thick fur because it runs big, so it won’t be too tight on your pet. The easy-release buckle side enclosure also makes it easy to snap on and off, and it covers a significant amount of your pet’s back, evenly distributing the cooling properties across their body.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Multi-layer self-cooling fabric | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Small, Medium, Large, X-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-dogs-unipup-mesh-breathable-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Small Dogs</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UNIPUP Mesh Breathable Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UNIPUP Mesh Breathable Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/AaIYwtTt_Ty2e1_8N5XQWFwBh6o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kurgo-core-cooling-vesunipup--mesh-breathable-cooling-vestt-15d205fb95674296ac4c37b3ad32f68d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This vest is a great option for smaller pets because it has a snug fit. If you find that most garments you buy for your dog fit too loosely, you’ll appreciate that this has a snug fit that will keep the cold and moisture in and push the heat out. Little dogs don’t need much to cool off, so this lightweight and breathable material will provide just the right amount of cold to get them through summertime walks, hikes, or days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another bonus is that each pack comes with two, so while you’re using one, the other can be cooling off in the fridge for maximized benefit. Or, if it gets dirty after a day of play, you’ll have a clean one on hand. On this note, we really appreciate that the nylon/spandex blended fabric is machine-washable.

If you want a high-quality, low-frills option, you’ll love the icy blue machine-washable fabric, which is designed to concentrate its cooling properties evenly across your dog’s core. What we loved most about this vest is how effective but lightweight it is, thanks to the breathable mesh innermost layer which keeps your dog from feeling weighed down by fabric — it keeps the evaporation of water steady so that it continuously wicks heat away. We also really liked the 2-way zipper on the back of the vest, which allows for easy access with a leash if they’re wearing a collar or harness underneath.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it is on the pricier side, the amazing reviews from pet owners, coupled with the sleek and high-quality features, made it a no-brainer for us to have on this list.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Mesh, Polyester, Synthetic Fabric | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Small, Medium, Large, X-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-durable-popetpop-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Most Durable</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>POPETPOP Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="POPETPOP Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WJhkKMMY6BpnZhUwx7vbhF9pNi8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/popetpop--dog-cooling-vest-72c015ef315d43bcacc86cfff2a708f1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Popetpop dog cooling vest is perfect for adventurous dogs who like to play rough. We know it can be frustrating when you buy a sweater or toy for your pet, and they tear it to shreds within days. Pet owners celebrate this vest because of its high-quality feel and because of how long it lasts — you may be concerned about how long a cooling vest will stay damp in the heat, but its cooling effects last for hours, so your dog can enjoy playtime outside without overheating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciate that it has a multi-layer cooling fabric: Cotton in the middle provides constant cooling, while mesh on the outside sends heat out and off of your dog. Something to note: Many pet owners reported that this vest does run a bit small, so while you should follow their measuring guidelines to be safe, sizing up may be a good idea.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester, Mesh, Cotton | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Small, Medium, Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-reflective-uiliko-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Reflective</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>UILIKO Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="UILIKO Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/71nPn_J9FhFIHJanweTa3rAEuwg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/uiliko--dog-cooling-vest-3e7ce9a6a8454419baa1724165e0ffe4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>Pet owners did note that this doesn’t stay wet and cold for very long, so if you want something for prolonged outdoor playtime, this may not be the best choice.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do you take lots of nighttime summer walks with your dog, or have a wanderer that you need extra help keeping an eye on?

This is the biggest reason why we think it’s best for going on walks — your dog will most likely be up close and personal with cement that reflects lots of heat. The ice packs provide intense and high-powered cooling effects that will keep your dog from overheating. The inside of the vest has sewn-in pockets for the ice pack inserts, and the vest itself has subtle design features that are ideal for being on the move, from accordion stitching that maximizes mobility to an opening on the back for easy access to a leash and collar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is on the pricier side so it may not be realistic for all budgets, but if you and your dog go on lots of walks (and your priority is keeping them cool in those times), you’ll certainly get your money’s worth.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Mesh | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Small, Medium, Large, X-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-camping-gorsbark-adjustable-dog-cooling-vest></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Camping</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gorsbark Adjustable Dog Cooling Vest</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gorsbark Adjustable Dog Cooling Vest" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5Ed8WgdhyJZX7K9h4o5di6HVgns=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gorsbark--adjustable-dog-cooling-vest-5db40b292fae4c38ad438997654db1b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s good for</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This is perfect for camping trips where durability, visibility, and prolonged cooling strength are an absolute must.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who it’s not good for</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Do you have a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>big camping trip</a> planned, but you’re worried about how your dog will fare in the heat?

It feels sturdy and sewn into the vest well, so you don’t have to worry about it snapping and breaking. This is especially handy if you plan on having your dog tethered at your campground and are worried about them getting loose. Like most others on this list, this is activated by submerging it in water, but you can easily touch it up with water from a water bottle or a spigot on your campground.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Mesh | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Sizes: </strong>Small, Medium, X-Large</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-dog-cooling-vest></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Dog Cooling Vest</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Durability&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re purchasing a cooling vest, you probably plan on spending time outside adventuring with your dog. They’ll probably come into contact with mud and dirt or be adventuring and playing extra rough, so durability is especially important when picking the right one for your dog. One way you can know that a vest is high quality is the type of enclosure it has — we love buckle enclosures because those tend to be stronger than velcro. Additionally, dirt and debris are more likely to get caught in velcro, so it looks and feels weaker faster.&nbsp;Our best investment pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Dog Vest</a>, takes it one step further and has a zipper enclosure so your dog will stay securely in their vest and dirt won't weaken the material.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the vest's material doesn’t allow for proper evaporation and breathability, then its cooling properties are a complete waste. When looking at a vest’s product page, see what type of fabric it’s made with and if it explicitly has design features that keep this in mind. A mesh outer layer is often a good sign that the material is breathable and will allow excess moisture and heat to repel off your dog, like our top pick for small dogs, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Unipup Quick Dry Dog Shirt</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Much like how you’d shop for a coat, life jacket, or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>harness for your pet</a>, it’s important that the cooling vest fits properly so your dog can stay cool and safe. Most retailers provide measurement guidelines on their website, so you should follow those instructions to make sure the specific vest you pick fits appropriately. But there are a few general rules of thumb you can follow when shopping online: “A good fit is indicated if you can comfortably slide two fingers between the life jacket and your dog's body,” says Askeland, adding that you should monitor their movements to make sure the vest doesn't limit their mobility.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-9e09d4d4-9254-4ab8-be89-e1b1888ed75d></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=49><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Why do dogs need cooling vests?</span></p><p>While dogs regulate their temperature differently than humans, keeping their exterior cool can help keep them comfortable. “Cooling vests are beneficial in hot weather or during outdoor activities in high temperatures, helping to prevent heatstroke and dehydration in dogs,” Askeland says.</p><p>Dogs participating in intense physical activities, like hiking or running, can benefit from wearing cooling vests during the summer months.

Generally, we’ve found that pet owners like the vests that you submerge in water — these ones do a good job of keeping your pet cool, and they stay fairly lightweight as they dry so you don’t have to worry about your dog inadvertently being overheated because of a heavy vest.
