$4,560,000</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/JF-US-VERY-EXPENSIVE-COINS-ROUNDUP-COMP-01.jpg><p>The 1913 Liberty Head nickels are among the best-known and most sought-after US coins in existence.</p><p>As the US Mint transitioned from the Liberty nickel series to Buffalo nickels in 1913, a handful of final Liberty coins were created with a 1913 mint year.</p><p>There are just five known examples of the coin, according to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PCGS</a>.</p><p>Two are permanently in museum collections including one at the Smithsonian, leaving just three for collectors.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>In 2021, a collector <a href=#>netted</a> more than $13million by selling a 1913 Liberty Head along with an 1804 dollar and an 1894 dime.</p><p>The highest standalone sale price for a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was $4.56million for a proof coin at auction in 2018, according to the PCGS.</p><h2>2. 1918/17-D Nickel - $350,750</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/JF-US-VERY-EXPENSIVE-COINS-ROUNDUP-COMP-02.jpg><p>A small number of nickels produced in <a href=#>Denver in 1918</a> contain an error that the US Mint tried to hide.</p><p>If you look closely at the year stamped onto the front of the coin, you may notice that the "8" in 1918 looks somewhat distorted.</p><p>The top of the number is flat instead of rounded, and the middle appears thicker than it should.</p><p>This is because the Mint mistakenly struck 1917 dates and punched the 1918 year over it.&nbsp;</p><p>There are about 7,000 of these coins still in existence today, with around 6,900 of them in circulation.</p><p>“The 1918/7-D is certainly the rarest coin in the Buffalo nickel series and it is one of the most important coins of the 20th Century,” former PCGS President David Hall&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>At a 2006 auction tracked by <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PCGS</a>, one of these coins in mint condition sold for $350,750.</p><h2>3. 1926-S Buffalo Nickel -

around 44million - were minted in Philadelphia, and another 5.6million were made in Denver.</p><p>But at the San Francisco Mint, just 970,000 1926 nickels were made, and just 11,000 still exist today, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PCGS</a>.</p><p>While the Denver nickels hold some value and are worth upwards of $100 in circulated condition, the 1926-S nickel is a prized key date coin.</p><p>A 1926-S coin in mint state sold for a record $322,000 at an <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">auction</a> in 2008, and circulated variations of the coin can sell for up to $5,000.</p><p>A seller <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">on eBay</a> recently netted a little over $1,000 by selling a 1926-S nickel.</p><h2>4. 1916 doubled die Buffalo nickel -

the metal pieces used to imprint emblems on coins - typically strike coins multiple times to ingrain the image or text.</p><p>Because of misaligned die strikes, the letters, numbers, and images on some coins look as if they were stamped on twice in slightly different spots.</p><p>These doubled die errors make coins immensely valuable, as usually only a small number of coins are affected when an error occurs.</p><p>More than 15,000 1916 nickels minted in Philadelphia still exist, but only about 400 have doubled die errors, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">PCGS</a>.</p><p>Even in poor condition, these coins are worth at least $2,000, and they can sell for more than $50,000 in circulated condition.</p><p>Uncirculated variations of the nickel sell for hundreds of thousands, including a record $276,000 <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">sale</a> in 2008 for a 1926 doubled die coin in mint condition.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>The Sun&nbsp;<a href=#>revealed</a>&nbsp;the most valuable coins minted since 2020.</p><p>We also listed the&nbsp;<a href=#>most valuable dollar coins</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfaoN2hZJvcGiln6jBbsLApayampyaeq%2B1wqScpatdqsBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marcus-ornellas-19820519-html.html><span>←</span><span>Marcus Ornellas (Soap Opera Actor) -
