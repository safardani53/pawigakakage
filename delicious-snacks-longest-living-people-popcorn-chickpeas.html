Pop some corn</h2><p>Who doesn't love plunging their hand into a tub of hot, buttery popcorn at the cinema?</p><p>But to eat the snack the Blue Zone way, it's best to do away with the dairy, according to Dan.</p><p>Instead, try buying the kernels - a whole grain loaded with antioxidants and fibre - and popping them yourself in olive oil or coconut oil.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Diet & Fitness</h2></p><p>Simply sprinkle with a little salt and enjoy!</p><p>If you want a little extra flavour, why not add in some turmeric or nutritional yeast for cheesiness, fresh or dried herbs, or even cinnamon?</p><h2>2. Earthy edamame</h2><p>According to Dan's research, soy-based foods like soybeans, tofu, and miso are key staples in the traditional diet in Okinawa, Japan - one of the famed Blue Zones.</p><p>The same goes for edamame - also known as soybeans - which are rich in protein, fibre and antioxidants while being low in calories.</p><p>If you're used to adding salt crusted edamame to your Japanese takeout, this is your sign to try preparing it yourself at home for a healthy snack.</p><p>You can buy a pack of frozen beans in supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's for around £2.</p><p>Simply <span id=27422c63-ed2d-46a7-a8b1-4ca4ab262d76 class=suggested-link>steam</span> them and sprinkle them with a little salt or black pepper and dig in.</p><h2>3. Crispy chickpeas</h2><p>If you're looking for an alternative to the crispy more-ishness of crisps, roasted chickpeas might become your new go-to snack.</p><p>Beans are a staple of Blue Zoner's diets, so it makes sense they'd choose them as a snack too.</p><p>All you need to do is spread a drained can of chickpeas on a baking tray, along with a couple tablespoons of olive oil and some spices of your choice, and roast.</p><p>Good spice options include cumin, chilli powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika.</p><h2>4. Nutty nibbles</h2><p>Nuts are a staple snack food for Blue Zones residents.</p><p>They're small but dense with vitamins and minerals - though they are calorific, so you want to avoid mindlessly snacking them.</p><p>Watch out for salted or caramelised nuts, too.</p><p>The ideal mix includes almonds, peanuts, cashews, <span id=7716d890-dcf4-407c-b8ce-845b142b20d6 class=suggested-link>Brazil</span> nuts and walnuts.</p><p>You can also add seeds and some dried fruit like goji berries - but bear in mind that dried fruits are sugary, so keep them to a minimum.</p><p>Stick to a maximum of two small handfuls of your trail mix a day.</p><h2>5. Refreshingly fresh fruit</h2><p>You can't do better than some fresh fruit for a snack.</p><p>Take your pic of whatever is in season. For October in the UK, this includes apples, blackberries and pears.</p><p>Your supermarket will also likely stock stuff like grapes, kiwis and pineapples.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2>6. Heavenly hummus</h2><p>Another way to try Blue Zoners' beloved beans is to blitz them into a hummus.</p><p>Of course, you can buy a tub in most supermarkets, but making it yourself means you can control the contents and add flavours like roasted garlic, red peppers, coriander, lime and even avocado.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIZ0f5hra2tnlJq5qq%2FIqKysZaOjrqS30majqKaXmsC1ecuiraKml2K9prvPpZxmqJ%2BlsLC%2BzWaaoaGToL2mrdJo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flip-or-flop-tarek-el-moussa-muscles-photoshoot-christina.html><span>←</span><span>Tarek El Moussa Shows Off His Ripped Muscles Days After Christina's Bikini Shoot</span></a>
