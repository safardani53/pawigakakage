They know and trust the staff who work there and they are creatures of habit.</p><p>“Kate used to go there, the Middletons used to go there. The family love it.”</p><p>Last year, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took their three kids to the island, and <a href=#>Prince George celebrated turning five by learning to swim in the crystal-clear water.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

22, so could once again celebrate on the getaway.</p><p>Both he and Princess Charlotte, four, broke up from school and nursery respectively in the first week of July.</p><p>The island, which is part of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, has hosted a number of royal and A-lister holidaymakers over the years.</p><p>The 1,400-acre island was the haunt of Princess Margaret back in the day, along with the likes Mick Jagger, and has been seen over the years as a trendy place to a hang out.</p><p>The source added: “It’s about as close as they can come to without going to total wilderness as they did on their honeymoon when they went to an island in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>“To go to a place with two bars and a few other people, and not feel totally isolated Mustique is perfect.”</p><img

fans desperate to see some snaps from their trip will probably be left disappointed.</p><p>Mustique is an entirely private island and has its own police force to keep its rockstar and socialite clientele away from prying eyes.</p><p>The security on the island is headed up by former Scotland Yard Chief Simon Humphrey and he is said to often be spotted travelling around the island, which is made up of pristine white beaches and crystal clear aquamarine waters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000491367105.jpg><p>The website says: “Every&nbsp;island visitor&nbsp;is registered with our security team before arriving on island by land, air or sea, whether staff, local islander or guest to ensure the security team know who is on island at any one time.</p><p>“With such a conscientious and&nbsp;friendly team looking after you, rest assured, you will never want to leave.”</p><p>The Caribbean holiday is likely to be a family affair, as last year the family were joined by Kate’s parents Carole and Michael Middleton, sister Pippa and her ­husband James Matthews.</p><p>The Queen and Prince Philip&nbsp;have visited in 1966, 1977 and 1985, and David Bowie once owned a villa on the island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

before returning to work in September.</p><p>They will make an exception on Friday August 9 when they are scheduled to host The King’s Cup sailing regatta in Cowes in support of their royal patronages.</p><p>The couple will each skipper one of the sailboats in the eight-boat race, which is fitting as both are keen sailors.</p><img

expected that the family may make the traditional visit to the Queen’s summer home Balmoral Castle during the summer.</p><p>The last time we saw Kate and Prince William was when they watched the Wimbledon Men’s Final together, with the kids enjoying a day out at the Englefield Summer Fete with grandparents Carole and Michael.</p><p>Kensington Palace has been contacted by Fabulous Digital but declined to comment.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON THE ROYAL FAMILY</h2></p><p>We shared how the <a href=# rel>Queen’s Balmoral Castle home is full of bats – and she walks around with servants who chase them with nets.</a></p><p>It has been reported the Queen <a href=#>could be forced make a 500-mile dash back to London this year</a> - to allow the next Prime Minister
