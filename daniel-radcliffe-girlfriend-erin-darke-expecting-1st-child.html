Darke’s character strikes up a brief flirtation with Radcliffe’s character, before the two share an intimate moment in a library. The stars were first spotted together at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where they were promoting the film.</p><p>“They were affectionate most of the night,” a source told Us at the time, adding that Michigan native “was touching his knee” at their VIP table. “They were a little more obvious outside the venue after they were leaving,” in witness added.</p><p>For Radcliffe, the movie serves as a recording of <a href=#>their early romance</a>. “That’s a wonderful record of us flirting for the first time,” the England native told <a href=#>Playboy</a> in October 2015 about meeting his love. “There’s no acting going on — not from my end, anyway. There’s a moment when she makes me laugh, and I’m laughing as me and not as my character. She was incredibly funny and smart. I knew I was in trouble.”</p><p>Radcliffe has been with Darke for the better part of a decade. In 2020, he gushed about how she embraced his geeky side, which includes loving LEGO and the New York Giants.</p><p>“I grew up doing lots of things where I thought, ‘This is super nerdy. I’ll never be able to do this around a girl,’” he the UK outlet <a href=#>Metro</a> in January 2020. “But that’s the wonderful thing about the moment you find the relationship you’re meant to be in. … It’s like, ‘Oh, I can do all of that stuff and you don’t mind. And you actually think it’s fun, too. This is fantastic!’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Radcliffe, best known for playing The Boy Who Lived, is not the first of the younger Potter cast to welcome a baby.<a href=#> <strong>Rupert Grint</strong></a>, who played Ron Weasley, shares <a href=#>daughter Wednesday</a>, 2, with<a href=#> <strong>Georgia Groome</strong></a>.
