I know. It's not the quarantine content we expected, but it's the quarantine content we deserve. And Bobby Boucher himself, the Adam Sandler, has given his stamp of approval.
Ariana Grande first posted a video of herself, Elizabeth Gillies, and her friend Aaron recreating a scene from 'The Waterboy' on April 5."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Ariana plays Adam Sandler's character, Bobby Boucher, Elizabeth Gillies plays Vicki Vallencourt, portrayed by Fairuza Balk in the movie, and Aaron dons a wig to play an adoring fan. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's high art. It belongs in a museum. There's something about Ariana's face that's just perfect. And the most important part is that Adam Sandler himself approves. He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reposted the video on Twitter</a> along with the message, "Bobby Boucher approves of this message."</p><p>But they weren't done. On April 8, Ariana took to Twitter again to post another Waterboy video, this time with Victorious costar Elizabeth Gillies but also with her mom, Joan, bringing the heat as Mama Boucher, who was originally played by Kathy Bates. These are all performances for the ages.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ariana's second 'Waterboy' recreation takes the commitment even further.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elizabeth&nbsp;tweeted</a> in response, "I could honestly watch you as Bobby Boucher all day," and I'm pretty sure that's what we were all thinking. There's something in Ariana's face that just perfectly captures Adam Sandler's ridiculousness.</p><p>Also, we cannot gloss over the fact that Ariana and Elizabeth are still friends after all these years! I'm so glad Victorious led to this friendship, if even just for this moment in time. I think I will be watching this recreated Waterboy scene for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ariana's mom, Joan, totally nails her performance too. Talk about committed. And the costumes are second-to-none. A dedicated fan made and posted a side-by-side, and let me just say, Wow.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Like, I don't understand how everyone involved just had these pieces lying around. The peach jacket! The bright orange wig! The red lipstick and gold pearl necklace! I mean, come on.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And don't you worry. Adam Sandler saw this one too. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He retweeted it</a> with the caption, "A tough day for Bobby...Vicki...and Mama."&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, these videos have gone totally viral and racked up hundreds of thousands of likes and retweets. I hope they send these to the Library of Congress because these deserve to be preserved forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And more than anything, I hope that these videos are not over. In fact, if Ariana could enlist a bunch of her friends to recreate the entire movie, I think her fans would be eternally grateful.&nbsp;</p><p>She could even move on to other Adam Sandler classic. I, for one, would love to see Ariana Grande recreate The Wedding Singer shot for shot. She could even record her own version of "Grow Old With You." Go ahead, Ariana. You can have that idea for free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bqrc2aZKCqkaOxpnnWmqueqpKkxm6tw5qkZquRo7GtsdE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-hank-kuehne-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Hank Kuehne Dating Now</span></a>
