Our PEOPLE Tested team tried out 36 kinds of toothpaste from some of the top brands available, guided by expert input from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Edmond R.

It is when it’s Made By Dentists Toothpaste for Total Care (the brand was formerly known as Spotlight Oral Care). We loved the paste’s thick consistency that went on smoothly and foamed up just enough to give our teeth a good, gentle scrubbing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Made By Dentists toothpaste's key ingredient is sodium fluoride to protect against cavities and strengthen enamel. Some toothpastes overcompensate with their minty flavor, but not this one. We loved that the flavor wasn’t overpowering but strong enough to keep our mouths feeling fresh until it was time to eat again.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the luxurious feel of brushing with this paste, the price tag also reflects the luxury. While it's pricier than some budget-friendly options we tested, we can say that the consistency is thick enough, so a little goes a long way. If you like a good, minty toothpaste that will leave your mouth incredibly clean for hours, this might be worth the splurge for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4.2 oz. | <strong>Formula: </strong>Paste<strong> </strong>|<strong> Flavor: </strong>Mint | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Sodium fluoride</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-less-expensive-colgate-sensitive-prevent--repair-toothpaste></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall, Less Expensive</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Colgate Sensitive Prevent & Repair Toothpaste</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Colgate Sensitive Prevent & Repair Toothpaste" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0obNbVgNHQ-kYF7aioG4U6n9Q8A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/colgate-sensitive-prevent--repair-toothpaste-60f228e064f14d678541beee16d2afa9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Taste</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you draw the line at pricey toothpaste, we have another excellent option at a better price point. (The price is similar but you get nearly twice as much in the tube!) Colgate Sensitive Prevent & Repair Toothpaste made our teeth feel clean and fresh from the first time we used it. We were using another brand of toothpaste to take care of our sensitive teeth, but Colgate was a game changer.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We liked the smooth consistency of this toothpaste, which lathers nicely and spreads easily. The flavor is just minty enough without being overpowering. There was no burning or tingling that you can get with other super-minty toothpastes, so there’s no need to rush our brushing. Our teeth even seemed to be whiter after using this during testing, so it was a no-brainer to switch to using Colgate Sensitive Prevent & Repair Toothpaste in our daily brushing routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6 oz. | <strong>Formula: </strong>Paste<strong> </strong>| <strong>Flavor: </strong>Gentle mint | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Potassium nitrate, sodium fluoride</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-colgate-total-deep-clean-toothpaste></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Colgate Total Deep Clean Toothpaste</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Colgate Total Deep Clean Toothpaste" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/LR_8YaPVQ1XTM3D5OhXVBLL9Ve4=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Colgate-Total-Deep-Clean-Toothpaste-29dbb773c5564bf89a1c0b39bf241843.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Taste</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>It’s a basic, budget-friendly toothpaste that cleans your entire mouth.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It offers round-the-clock antibacterial protection.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nothing makes you feel like you’re pouring your hard-earned money down the drain like toothpaste.

Our teeth felt smooth and clean after using it. We found it to be an especially good pairing with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a solid electric toothbrush</a>, but manual toothbrushes will do just fine, too. It’s got a mild, minty taste that’s not at all overpowering but enough to make your entire mouth feel clean after brushing. It also offers 24-hour antibacterial protection which we like, and despite that powerful feature, we didn’t feel any sensitivity when using it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you want something mintier, you’ll have to choose another toothpaste or follow up with mouthwash, but for a clean, fresh mouth, you can’t go wrong with the simplicity of Colgate Total Deep Clean Toothpaste.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5.1 oz. | <strong>Formula: </strong>Paste | <strong>Flavor: </strong>Light mint | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>0.454% stannous fluoride (0.15% w/v fluoride ion)</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Ashleigh Morley</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-gums-crest-gum-detoxify-deep-clean-toothpaste></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Sensitive Gums</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Crest Gum Detoxify Deep Clean Toothpaste</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Crest Pro Health Gum Detoxify Toothpaste, Deep Clean, 4.1 oz" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/00hEDsU9O5a6eZj205FHHvjRMvQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/crest-pro-health-gum-detoxify-toothpaste-deep-clean-41-oz-8381cf2df65c4f69a1bb5e1fc16ba7fa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Taste</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have sensitive gums, then you know that some toothpastes, especially whitening ones, can make things worse.

But despite this deep-clean feeling, we had no sensitivity issues. This gentle toothpaste has a thick, creamy consistency that spreads easily while brushing. Only a pea-size amount is needed to get the right amount of foam to reach all teeth, but not so much that we had to spit out the toothpaste before our two-minute brushing session was over.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We liked that there was a nice, light scent of mint without it being too overpowering. In fact, it left a rather pleasant, cool feeling in our mouth. Most importantly, our sensitive gums seemed just fine, even though this toothpaste seemed to take care of plaque buildup effectively. This toothpaste is priced a bit higher than others on the list, but if it means having irritation-free gums, it’s well worth the extra money.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>3.7 oz. | <strong>Formula: </strong>Paste<strong> </strong>| <strong>Flavor: </strong>Mint | <strong>Key Ingredients: </strong>Fluoride</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2186 data-sizes=750px alt="A person adding a dot of Crest Gum Detoxify Deep Clean Toothpaste to a toothbrush" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/-Y4-aPXGoKaGn3_mPEWUqvpOIyU=/fit-in/1500x2186/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-toothpaste-test-crest-pro-health-gum-detoxify-megan-wood-08-f1f2701ad4e1480dbcd3d4952b18002e.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Megan Wood</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2211 data-sizes=750px alt="A person using a toothbrush to brush their teeth with Crest Gum Detoxify Deep Clean Toothpaste" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/0C4M4oaatOcojVgf1pvP3sqkqqU=/fit-in/1500x2211/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-toothpaste-test-crest-pro-health-gum-detoxify-megan-wood-04-c0b58da35b0e4a0290ef1603db75c641.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Megan Wood</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-whitening-arm--hammer-essentials-whiten--strengthen-fluoride-toothpaste></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Whitening</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Arm & Hammer Essentials Whiten & Strengthen Fluoride Toothpaste</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart Arm & Hammer Essentials Whiten & Strengthen Fluoride Toothpaste" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/W-jTZScBE1TxOat5m8tDZMO7uW4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Arm--Hammer-Essentials-Whiten--Strengthen-Fluoride-Toothpaste-55098d216117479fbfbb7c412d6ae626.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Taste</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>It cleans the entire mouth with the gentle power of baking soda.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s great for those with sensitive teeth.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Our teeth did in fact whiten over the testing period.<br></p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Arm & Hammer is a household name known for, among other things, its baking soda.

Not so with these tablets. They foam up nicely so that the paste can reach around the entire mouth for easy brushing without clumping. It was also quite easy to rinse out, too.

Oddly enough, we noticed a stronger mint flavor as we brushed and especially when we rinsed, so the flavor does live up to its yuzu/minty name.

The consistency is smooth and easy to apply to our brush and teeth without sticking or clumping. We find it foams up just enough so you do not constantly have to spit during your brushing routine. A little goes a long way, too. In fact, we’ve found ourselves using a lot less of the HiSmile than we did our previous toothpaste, so there’s value in the pump — which is also super cute to leave out on your bathroom counter.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">HiSmile comes in 10 different flavors: watermelon, grape bubblegum, strawberry, banana, vanilla, coconut whip, mango sorbet, peach iced tea, coconut whip, red velvet, and for toothpaste traditionalists, smooth mint.
