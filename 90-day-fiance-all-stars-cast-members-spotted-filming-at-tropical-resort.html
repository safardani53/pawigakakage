Angela, Big Ed, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Unfortunately, the threat of some sort of 90 Day Fiance “all stars” special is simply too real to ignore. But there are some bright spots.</p><p>It appears that multiple cast members — we’ll list them in a moment — have been “vacationing” together on camera in the Florida Keys.</p><p>How do we know this? First and foremost, because a number of angry vacationers have posted reviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>An Isla Bella Resort review reads: “The only downside was there was filming for 90 day fiance during our stay” without warning from the hotel staff.</p><p>“There were crews everywhere and at first was fine but became a bit annoying,” the TripAdvisor review lamented.</p><p>The review cited: “For example, we were going to play a game hosted by the resort by the bar at night but was cancelled because they were filming.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This TripAdvisor review was far from alone.</p><p>A lot of people had positive and negative things to say about the hotel. Honestly? It sounds like most people enjoyed their stay.</p><p>But a number of people had two major gripes — that 90 Day Fiance cast members were filming, and that they received no warning in advance. Vacation time is generally pretty limited — some of them might have booked a trip for a time when they could, you know, actually enjoy the hotel.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That said … who exactly was there, terrorizing hotel guests? Eyewitnesses are not keeping us guessing.</p><p>Angela Deem. Big Ed Brown. And, tragically, Liz Woods — who, <a href=#>as we have previously reported</a>, seems to be back with Ed.</p><p>And then there are a couple of fan-favorite (if not universally beloved) couples: Jovi and Yara … and Kalani and Asuelu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>So, what exactly are they working on?</p><p>Apparently, there is a little more (fake) depth to this special than, say, Peacock’s Ultimate Girls Trip for the Real Housewives franchise.</p><p>Reports suggest that it’s something closer to Marriage Boot Camp. Except that it is solely for 90 Day Fiance couples.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Big Ed is one of the most twisted and toxic men on the franchise.</p><p>By their own count, they are up to eleven breakups — at least. The latest of which took place on the Tell All stage.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of us feared that Liz would get back with Ed. It is difficult to watch someone make such a self-destructive decision once, let alone a dozen times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Kalani Faagata and Asuelu Pulaa’s marriage has been so troubled that, when they both announced that they were moving last year, fans weren’t sure if they were even moving to the same place.</p><p>In fact … a lot remains very uncertain. To the point where most of us concluded that they were still under contract and might film again.</p><p>Can a counseling session on camera at a tropical resort fix all of their problems? Obviously not. But it will be nice for viewers to check in with them, anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Any therapist who has any ethics whatsoever would counsel Michael to leave his abusive wife, Angela.</p><p>We won’t be holding our breath for whoever production hires for this to give Michael this much-needed counsel. Make of that what you will.</p><p>Meanwhile, zero reports have suggested that Michael is in Florida. Which may mean that he’s still waiting on his visa, and will participate remotely if at all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Yara and Jovi have genuine disagreements. But between Ed’s despicable behavior and Angela verbally, emotionally, and physically abusing her husband … their issues don’t compare.</p><p>Their issues don’t compare with Kalani and Asuelu’s either. That couple seemed on the verge of divorce. Yara and Jovi just need to work out some big questions for their family.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what comes of all of this. We’ll know more when TLC announces it all.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2V%2BcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5kmqScYsC1rdGsZJyZo6l6rrHMm5yrq12ovbDA056bZp6ZobqqusZmmK1lpKe8sbXCmqNmqpWovLPAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worlds-sexiest-woman-ashley-graham-real-legs-panties.html><span>←</span><span>World's Sexiest Woman Ashley Graham shows off legs in black panties in behind-the-scenes video from</span></a>
