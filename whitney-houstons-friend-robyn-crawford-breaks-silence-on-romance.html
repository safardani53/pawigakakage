They quickly became friends and eventually lovers.</p><p>“Our friendship was a deep friendship,” she recalled. “In the early part of that friendship, it was physical.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Whitney-Houston-Robyn-Crawford-Today.jpg><p>The A Song for You: My Life With Whitney Houston author explained that no one else knew about their romance, which ended before the Grammy winner became an international sensation in the early 1980s.</p><p>“She said, ‘I don’t believe we should be physical anymore,’” Crawford recounted.</p><p>“Were you sad? Were you angry? Were you disappointed?” Melvin, 40, asked.</p><p>“I just felt that I wouldn’t be losing much,” she responded. “I still loved her the same, and she loved me. And that was good enough.”</p><p>After their physical relationship ended, Crawford and Houston maintained a friendship for many years.</p><p>“I felt an urgency to stand up and share the woman behind the incredible talent,” Crawford writes in her upcoming book, per <a href=#>NBC News</a>. “I wanted to lift her legacy, give her respect and share the story of who she was before the fame, and in that, to embrace our friendship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Whitney-Houston-Bobby-Brown-and-Robyn-Crawford.jpg><p>Houston, who <a href=#>died in an accidental drowning</a> at the age of 48 in 2012, never publicly spoke about her love affair with Crawford, although it was <a href=#>widely speculated</a>. Their relationship was also heavily discussed in the <a href=#>2018 documentary Whitney</a>.</p><p>Houston’s mother, <strong>Cissy Houston</strong>, said in a 2013 interview that she “absolutely” would have been bothered if the “I Will Always Love You” singer had been gay.</p><p>However, Crawford writes in her book that she and Whitney “never talked about labels, like lesbian or gay. We just lived our lives and I hoped it could go on that way forever.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The entertainer was married to <a href=#><strong>Bobby Brown</strong></a> from 1992 to 2007. She and the New Edition member, 50, shared daughter <a href=#>Bobbi Kristina Brown</a>, who <a href=#>died from lobar pneumonia</a> at age 22 in 2015.</p><p>Crawford’s full interview with Melvin airs on Dateline on NBC Saturday, November 9, at 9 p.m. ET.
