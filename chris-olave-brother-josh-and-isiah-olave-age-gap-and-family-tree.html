Other first-round notable picks of that draft year were Travon Walker, <a href=#>Aidan Hutchinson</a>, <a href=#>Sauce Gardner</a>, <a href=#>Charles Cross</a>, and <a href=#>Garrett Wilson</a>.</p><p>Olave made three receptions for 41 yards and a two-point conversion in his NFL debut in Week 1.</p><p>In his rookie season, he started in nine in 15 game appearances, concluding with 72 receptions for 1,042 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns.</p><p>Currently, he is on a <a href=# rel=noopener>four-year $19.2 million contract</a> with the Saints, which he signed on May 13, 2022.</p><h2>Chris Olave Brother: Josh & Isiah Olave, Their Age Gap?</h2><p>The California-born NFL player is one of three children, all sons, of his <a href=#>parents: LaCausha and Raul Olave</a>. He grew up with his two brothers, Isiah Olave and Josh Olave.</p><p>Born on June 27, 2000, Chris Olave is the youngest of three brothers. As of 2023, the Saints wide receiver is 23 years old.</p><p>Without the exact date of birth of Isiah and Joshua, their real-time age is not out but are allegedly in their 20s. As reported, Josh’s birthday falls on August 15.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chris-Olave-With-His-Brothers-Isiah-And-Josh.jpg><p>The Olave brothers’ age gap is not far apart but a few years.&nbsp;</p><p>The eldest one, Isiah, is a couple of years senior to the NFL star. As for the age gap between Chris and Josh, it doesn’t seem much.</p><p>All three attended the same high school, East Lake High School. Isiah Olave graduated in 2014, Joshua graduated in 2017 & & Chris was the class of 2018.</p><p>They are very close and often share pictures of them on family moments & vacations. They’ve been pillars of support for each other.</p><p>In October 2023, when the Kenner Police Department <a href=#>arrested Chris on the charge of reckless driving</a>, his brother Josh came to his defense via a Twitter post.</p><p>However, some views commented with a backlash to Josh for not addressing the violation of traffic rules.</p><h2>Chris Olave’ Brothers Competed In Collegiate Football</h2><p>The only Olave brother to land a deal in the NFL is Chris, while his brothers played football up to the collegiatee level only.</p><p>Isiah, the eldest brother, enrolled at the University of California, Davis, in 2014 and played through 2018.</p><p>The most-highlighted season was his senior season with the UC Davis Aggies. He made 66 tackles (including 37 solos), the third-highest among all Aggies. He was the recipient of the Captain’s Award.</p><p>After his college graduation, he didn’t get in the NFL draft while his update on his career is not out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/A-Throwback-Picture-Of-Chris-Isiah-And-Josh-Olave.jpg><p>On the other, Josh played three seasons at Azusa Pacific University (2017-19), where he became All-GNAC Second Team defense and <span>GNAC All-Academic honoree.</span></p><p>In December 2020, he transferred to Weber State University and played as a cornerback for a season. He led the Wildcats to a fourth straight Big Sky Championship with a 20-15 victory over Idaho State.</p><p>In an epic win over Northern Arizona with a 50-yard ‘Hail Mary’ pass, he made three tackles (two solo tackles).</p><h2>Family Tree Of Christian Olave: Parents And Ethnicity</h2><p>Olave is an American by nationality with a mixed ethnic background. His father, Raul, is of Cuban descent while his mother, LaCusha, has African-American roots.</p><p>His childhood was surrounded by financial insecurities as his parents were living paycheck to paycheck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Olave-With-His-Father.jpg><p>The NFL star’s dad did a night shift job for two decades to bring to the table, while his mom did two jobs.</p><p>Now, the scenario has changed and the family seemingly has a quality lifestyle. It seems convincing given that their son Chris earns millions of dollars per season.</p><h3>Isiah Olave Is A Father Of One</h3><p>Currently, Olave’s eldest brother Isiah is in a <a href=# rel=noopener>relationship with his partner Marcela Mendez</a>, a fellow graduate of UC Davis. They share a son named Josiah.</p><p>She serves as an account executive at Division-D (2022- present).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvx6ugrGWfoa63sYybqaismJq%2FbrbOrJ9mmZ6Zeqq%2FyJqfZqeclsOmecCgnGafkaV6orrDZp2apZmhxm7A0Z6caA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-bob-costas-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Bob Costas Dating Now</span></a>
