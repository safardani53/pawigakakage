Cleaning products are also crucial to keeping everything hygienic. Some might come with the toy, but if it doesn't then make sure you're investing in the right one because different materials have different requirements.</p><p>Once that's all in place, you're ready to spice up your sex life in 2023.</p><h2>Best sex toys for beginners at a glance</h2><h2>Lovehoney Magic Bullet 10 Function Bullet Vibrator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.lovehoneyassets.com/i/lovehoney/82347_a34002_black_000><ul><li><strong>Lovehoney Magic Bullet Vibrator 10 Function Bullet Vibrator, £12.99 from Lovehoney - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>A bullet vibrator should be on any beginner's sex toy list. Small and discreet it slips easily in to a bedside drawer or, if you're feeling adventurous, in to your handbag.</p><p>A bullet is incredibly straightforward to use. It uses vibrations to externally - key word, this is not meant to be used internally - stimulate your erogenous zones. This particular offering from Lovehoney has three speeds and seven patterns to click between giving you the opportunity to find your perfect combination.</p><p>It may be small at 4 inches, but size isn't everything and this little pocket rocket is packed full of power without being noisy.</p><p>As with most bullets, it is battery operated but it does only need one AAA battery to get going. Lovehoney has aptly described this toy as a 'climax machine' and whether you use it alone or with a partner, we're inclined to agree.</p><h2>We tested: <b>Ann Summers G-Spot Ripple Rampant Rabbit</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/AnnSummers.png><ul><li><strong>G-Spot Ripple Rampant Rabbit, £35 from Ann Summers - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This is a great multi-function rabbit vibrator that isn't too daunting for those who want to give sex toys a go for the first time.</p><p>It isn't super big or girthy, meaning that if you're already in the mood you won't need lube — although it is recommended for the most comfortable experience.</p><p>As a rabbit vibrator, it targets multiple erogenous zones, helping you to get a feel for what you like: the two soft rabbit ears give you external stimulation while the ribbed shaft takes care of internal affairs.</p><p>Once you insert three AA batteries (which are not included), you can choose from 10 settings, which offer a range of rhythms, intensities and pulsing motions.</p><p>However, you have to click through all of the settings to get back to the first, which we thought was slightly annoying.</p><p>You can also use it to mimic the in/out motion of sex, but that is at the sacrifice of clitoral stimulation.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><h2>We tested: Oliver James Wand Massager</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Oliver-james-massager.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Oliver James Wand Massager, £18.99 from eBay - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>This massager strikes the perfect balance between power and intensity. The large, round silicon head distributes vibrations softly throughout your erogenous zones without too much intensity which can be an issue with other external stimulators.</p><p>It turns on easily with a power button that sits on the front of the toy, then defaults to its continuous vibrator setting at the lowest strength level.</p><p>However, it still packs a punch — worth considering if your prefer a delicate touch. Click through the 20 — yes, 20 — different patterns using the middle button and then adjust the speed of the vibrations with the top button.</p><p>There are eight speeds, but note that it doesn't have a plus or minus button so if you want to go back to a lower speed you'll need to click through until the cycle restarts. The same goes for the patterns.</p><p>It's rechargeable and comes with a USB charger that plugs securely into the end of the toy, so there's no need to worry about the charger dropping off like magnetic ones tend to.</p><p>It takes two hours to reach max capacity but don't feel you need to wait that long if you're running short on time.</p><p>The massager is travel size but that doesn't mean it's mini; it's actually a pretty normal size for a portable vibrator.</p><p>It's easy to clean with a wipe or under running water, although it is only water-resistant so make sure not to submerge the massager fully.</p><p>Plus, this doesn't just have to be used as a stimulator; it can also work to massage your neck, shoulders, thighs or any other muscle that needs a bit of loosening.</p><h2>The Petit Eiffel - Frenchie</h2><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0351/0324/4426/products/frenchie-the-petit-eiffel-32864922370234.jpg> &nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The Petit Eiffel 7 mode mini vibrator, £51 from Frenchie - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Australian brand Frenchie has created a stylish range of fun, simple and safe sex toys for Francophiles - all with a certain 'je ne said quoi'!</p><p>With chic packaging and a simple design - available in rose or bleu (pink or blue) - the Petit Eiffel mini vibrator is not at all intimidating and ideal for a sex toy novice.</p><p>It's made from super soft silicone with a pin point flutter tip for targeted clitoral stimulation - and it's waterproof so you can use it&nbsp;wherever you like.</p><p>It's&nbsp;super easy to use with just one button - and a USB port to charge it up - plus, there are seven speeds and modes that you can adjust to find the perfect setting for you.</p><h2><strong>Powerful Pocket Clitoral Vibrator from Lovehoney</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Pocket-Clitoral-Vibrator-1-e1548954401636.jpg><ul><li><strong>BASICS Powerful Pocket Clitoral Vibrator, £9.99 from Lovehoney - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Lovehoney's Pocket Clitoral Vibrator may not look like it, but it packs a punch without being complicated to use or looking intimidating.</p><p>It comes with four interchangeable heads that offer different textures, including spiky and smooth, which is where you can get variety with this toy rather than through the vibrations themselves which are at a single speed.</p><p>A step up from a tiny bullet vibrator, which can be a bit of a one trick pony, this clitoral vibrator is easy to use and powerful without being indiscreet and loud.</p><p>It takes one AA battery, and you'll want to use a water-based lube with this one for the best results.</p><h2>Normal Billie Palm Vibrator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Palm.png><ul><li><strong>Billie palm vibrator, £95 from Normal - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Normal, Australia's hottest and most sustainble sex toy brand, isn't just for pros - but ideal for beginners who are looking to dip their toes into the wonderful world of battery-operated pleasure.</p><p>Ideal for solo use, or in couple's play, Normal's own Billie palm vibrator takes it nice and slow - helping you get all hot and heavy in a solo session, or in the run up to sex, with gentle, stroking motions.</p><p>It fits into your palm, is soft and flexible, and ideal for use on the clitoris, anus, nipples or perineum - or, you could get your partner to run it over your body, or clitoris, during intercourse to take bedroom fun to the next level.</p><p>The brand sends its products in unmarked, discreet packaging, which is fully compostable, and gives you 100 nights to test it out yourself for ultimate satisfaction, or your money back.</p><p>Not sure it's right for you?
