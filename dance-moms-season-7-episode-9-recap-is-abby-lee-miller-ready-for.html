Abby paired her up against Brynn to find out just how well the girl could dance.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>As the moms sat on the sidelines, rehearsals got underway, but Abby felt that Maesi did not fit into the performance and decided it would be best to remove her.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Jamie leapt to her daughter’s defense, but it fell on deaf ears. The worst thing anybody can do is try to imply they know better than ALM.&nbsp;</p><p>We all know just how annoyed she can get with people. That’s sort of what she does.&nbsp;</p><p>Abby was so desperate for Jane to fit in that she was getting close to making changes to the competition to give the kid some more prominence, but Nancy said that her daughter could dance better than Brynn.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/09/abby-lee-miller-is-the-worst-674x1024.jpg><p>I mean, Nancy and Jane were just in the door a few minutes and they got ready to cause trouble pretty much off the bat. Brynn’s mother took offense and started arguing with Nancy.&nbsp;</p><p>Abby then decided to give Maesi a solo because she impressed her during early rehearsals. Her performance would be a hip-hop number.&nbsp;</p><p>However, that’s the type of performance that cost Abby a win a few weeks ago, so it should be intriguing to find out how this one plays out.&nbsp;</p><p>There was a lot of drama early on because Maesi forgot her routine, but Jamie claimed that her daughter was yet to eat for the day and that’s part of the reason.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>With Jamie crying, Abby looked on in horror. Was she about to take the solo back?</p><p>The performances all went without a hitch and Abby was smiling from ear-to-ear throughout.</p><p>At the awards, Maesi, surprisingly, managed to beat out Brynn. The ALDC came in first place for the group number, but Abby decided that Jane did not make the cut for the team.&nbsp;</p><p>Her reason?</p><p>Jane did not do anything better than any of the other ladies, so her place was taken away. We are getting so close to nations now and Abby wants the best team she can have.&nbsp;</p><p>What did you think of all the drama?&nbsp;</p><p>Was Abby right to get rid of Jane?</p><p>Hit the comments!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Abby Lee Miller: The Beast of the East (Coast)</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2V%2BcLDAp5qeZZ2kurR50p6YrKeeYoRusc%2BiqqiclWKGbr7EnJipZZmoeqKuwbJkpZ2VYrqquMueqWaqlZaxunnFqKlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alex-batty-cult-mother-abandoned-moroccan-commune-bali-kidnapping.html><span>←</span><span>How Alex Batty's 'cult-obsessed' mum abandoned him in Moroccan commune to flee to Bali 3 years befor</span></a>
