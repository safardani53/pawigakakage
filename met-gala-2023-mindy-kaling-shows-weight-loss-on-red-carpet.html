Her Prabal Gurung gown featured a plunging neckline and thigh-high slit with purple floral embellishments on the shoulders. She accessorized with matching silk pumps and diamond jewelry.</p><p>The<a href=#> Sex Lives of College Girls</a> creator has been a frequent guest of the gala, <a href=#>making her debut in 2013</a> in a custom Lela Rose dress. She reflected on the prestigious night during a September 2022 conversation on <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>“Archetypes” podcast</a>.</p><p>“I did feel, like, fraudulent the first year I went. You don’t know the secret things you’re supposed to do, when I went I was staying downtown with a friend,” the Office alum explained. “I didn’t know you were supposed to stay uptown near the Met. You’re supposed to get in a standing van so your dress didn’t wrinkle. I was just in a cab, in my dress, sitting in the backseat of a car, you know, driving for 45 minutes.”</p><p>Kaling attended <a href=#>her first-ever Met</a> with BFF <a href=#><strong>B.J. Novak</strong></a>, telling Us Weekly at the time that she wanted to look “really friendly” on the carpet. “I just want to meet [<a href=#><strong>Anna Wintour</strong></a>] and not have her wrinkle her nose at me because I’ve worn something that isn’t right,” the Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) author teased.</p><p>The Emmy nominee’s <a href=#>return to the soirée</a> proved she’s become a pro — and showcased her weight transformation. Kaling has been candid about <a href=#>her wellness journey</a> through the years, especially since <a href=#>welcoming daughter Katherine and son Spencer</a> in 2017 and 2020, respectively.</p><p>“I feel like in conversations about fitness and exercise, if you’re going to be talking about someone who’s healthy and fit, you have to be a hard body with, like, a six-pack,” she told Self in May 2021. “But that’s not really how it works, and I have learned to embrace [my body] in the past six months [since having a baby].”</p><p>Nearly one year later, <a href=#>Kaling revealed her secret</a> to slimming down. “I eat what I like to eat. If I do any kind of restrictive diet, it never really works for me. I just eat less of it,” she told Entertainment Tonight in April 2022. “I wish there was something more juicy or dynamic about the way that I’ve lost a little bit of weight, but that’s the way I’ve done it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before strutting her stuff at Monday’s gala, Kaling rocked a white <a href=#>custom Vera Wang Haute Couture dress</a> — and changed into a black version — at the 2023 Oscars in March. The risqué design featured cutouts around her midriff and long sleeves.</p><p>Scroll down for a glimpse of Kaling’s <a href=#>2023 Met Gala</a> look:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvMnqtmn5Ghrm5%2Bj2tqZqWZo7G6ecqao6Kml2LAqbvWrGSwnZmctbV5y6iqrGWfo3qzscNmmpqqoJrBcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mahogany-roca-reveals-harrowing-overdose-im-thankful-to-be-alive.html><span>←</span><span>I'm Thankful to Be Alive!</span></a>
