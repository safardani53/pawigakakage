A six-time champion Flat jockey in Ireland, Ward, who was from Limerick, won the 1970 Irish Derby on one of the greatest horses of the 20th century.
He was retained rider for Vincent O'Brien and was remembered for being a 'gentleman' as much as a talented jockey.
Ward won ten Classics in Ireland and was one of the most sought-after riders at a time when O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable was the biggest in the world."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
