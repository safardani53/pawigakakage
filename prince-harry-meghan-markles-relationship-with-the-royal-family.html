Harry was also close with late Philip, who died in April 2021. “He was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right ‘til the end,” the duke <a href=#>wrote in a tribute</a> following his death.</p><p>Meghan, for her part, spoke highly of the queen during the pair’s CBS interview in March 2021. “The queen has always been wonderful to me,” she said, reflecting on learning to curtsey ahead of their first interaction. When they welcomed their daughter, Lili, in June 2021, <a href=#>Elizabeth was “overjoyed,”</a> a source told Us.</p><p>With the couple in California full-time, they’ve done their best to stay in touch with Harry’s relatives. Before Philip’s death, he had a funny way of ending their Zoom calls. “My grandfather, instead of, like, pressing ‘leave meeting,’ he [slams the laptop closed],” Harry teased in a February interview.&nbsp;</p><p>In April 2022, Harry and Meghan stopped in England to visit the queen while on their way to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands. The prince had not been to the U.K. since he and William unveiled the statue of their mother in July 2021, while Meghan had not returned since the duo made their royal exit official in March 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In June 2022, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex traveled back to the U.K. to celebrate the monarch's 70 years on the throne during her Platinum Jubilee. While the couple did not stand with the queen on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the Trooping the Colour, they enjoyed the parade from the Major General’s Office that overlooks the grounds.</p><p>The sovereign passed away three months after the Platinum Jubilee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6ecyenqGZnmK6or7KpZysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZK2glWK%2FsMXApWSfmZ2eubp7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./man-utd-fans-singing-section.html><span>←</span><span>Old Trafford matchday atmosphere set to take a hit as Man Utd's singing section REFUSE to take part</span></a>
