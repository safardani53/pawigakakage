And she’s very pleased she decided to lose weight on her own time. “I really gave my body time to adjust to postpartum and post-pregnancy,” the star told Us Weekly exclusively ahead of her Teen Vogue Summit speech on Saturday, December 1. “You know, it had a baby! It created a human life, so I really wasn’t too hard about getting back into shape.”</p><p>But now that the <a href=# rel=noopener>new mom</a>, 43, and her husband, <strong>José Bastón</strong>, have the baby thing down pat, the Desperate Housewives alum is getting back on a hard-core health kick. “Now I’m working out a lot more and watching what I eat. I’m barely starting to get back into it.”</p><p>And while Longoria finds yoga very therapeutic — “I still love yoga,” she says — she’s also going for something a little tougher to lose weight and tone up. “My workouts now are more weight training,” she tells Us. “Very serious weight training.”</p><p>The actress has always been devoted to health and wellness. “I’m a runner, I do yoga and I do Pilates, so it’s kind of like a rotation of those things,” she told Us&nbsp;in 2015 of her workout regimen. “And then I usually eat well … Diet and exercise is a part of my daily vocabulary.”</p><p>Her renewed dedication to fitness will help her get her through the indulgent holiday season, which she’ll spend abroad with Bastón, 50. “We’re gonna be in Mexico with our families, and we have a Christmas exchange that happens Christmas Eve and we all get to draw names and you know, exchange <a href=# data-gift=1>gifts</a>,” the star says. “It’s a really fun time in our household for Christmas.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Eva-Longoria-2.jpg><p>Not that she’s requesting any gifts for herself. “I feel &nbsp;like I have gotten my share of blessings and the biggest gift of all was Santi this year,” she gushes, “so I’m not asking for one thing!”</p><p><i>With reporting by Carly Sloane&nbsp;</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGaerpFiubC6xqipopmjYr2wv9NmmZqaqWKvsLDYZqmoraSeu6Z50Z6qrWWppLSiedaeoKCgpGLBs63Ip6Cnn18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cindy-rarick.html><span>←</span><span>Cindy Rarick</span></a>
