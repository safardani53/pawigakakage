However, upon finding out, they were less than happy. They were furious.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Chris Sullivan at the 2021 Emmy Awards </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Chris Sullivan Didn't Really Undergo Weight Loss</h2><p>For those of you not in the loop, Sullivan was wearing prosthetics for his role in This Is Us. He had a prosthetic costume popularly known as "fat suit" and a prosthetic jowl on for the first three seasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Sullivan was already a slim actor when he took on the role of Toby. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays&nbsp;Beth on the show, told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Us Weekly</a> back in 2017 that Sullivan was using the suit.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Chrissy Metz, who played Toby's wife on the show,&nbsp;was expected to undergo weight loss herself if&nbsp;the story demanded.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Although she clarified during an appearance on <a href=# rel=follow>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>,&nbsp;she wasn't "mandated" to lose weight, but that the weight loss is part of "the storyline." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Fans' Reaction to Chris Sullivan's Weight Loss</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>As things are now, it might be next to impossible for fans to envision anyone but Sullivan playing the role of Toby, weight loss or not.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, fans couldn't help but <a href=# rel=follow>lash out at the show</a>&nbsp;and the actor&nbsp;for not getting someone who would naturally fit Toby's character description.&nbsp;</p><p>"Like they couldn't find an actual overweight white male actor?" a fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another one <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">penned</a>,&nbsp;"Honestly pissed that the actor who plays toby on This Is Us wears a fat suit — how about some actual representation for plus sized men?"</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Chris Sullivan Reaction to Fans' Reaction</h2><p>At a point, the clamor from viewers from the show intensified to such a degree that Sullivan had to go out and make his statement heard.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In an exclusive with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">People</a>, Sullivan clarified what it meant to be an actor.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As you’ll find in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy 2, I’m not actually a space alien.
