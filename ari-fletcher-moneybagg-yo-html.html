The card read:</p><p>We are simple, and we are complex. We can be silent, and we can be loud...We may not always know the answers. We may not always make perfect decisions.

The rapper was the one to reveal the relationship, as he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">discussed his love life</a> with her during his interview with&nbsp;Hot 97.&nbsp;</p><p>"We rockin'. You know what I'm sayin'? What you see is what you get," he said, answering if he and Fletcher were dating. He also implied that he wanted&nbsp;to keep the budding relationship relatively private, saying, "...Hopefully, this situation can just go with the flow."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In late 2020, there were rumors that the couple had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">got engaged</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;Fletcher showed her luxury gifts, including a&nbsp;diamond ring. But the engagement hasn't been confirmed as of yet. In addition, the internet is also filled with their 'break up' and 'back together' rumors, all of which are baseless. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJminnqnuMStmqGdomK6sLrEspman5dixrB6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-sex-lives-of-college-girls-season-3-everything-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>'The Sex Lives of College Girls Season 3: Everything to Know</span></a>
