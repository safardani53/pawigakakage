The porn star curled up by the fireplace and took a photo of her bare, perfectly-tanned feet on Oct. 16, and she uploaded the pic to Twitter with the caption, “Sup, @StephenCurry30?” The message was a direct response to the recent revelation that the basketball star has a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>bit of a foot fetish</a>, a fact that his wife,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Ayesha Curry</strong></a>, shared with the world during an appearance on&nbsp;The Real last week. “My husband really loves my feet,” Ayesha revealed, while explaining why she had a photo of her feet on her phone. “And, so, like, the light was hitting them just right that day, and so I was like, ‘Let me just snap this photo and send him a picture of my feet!'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>She went on to joke that if Steph ever asks her to “send nudes,” she simply sends him a pic of her bare feet. Although Ayesha cracked up with&nbsp;The Real hosts over her admission, she also confessed, “He’s going to kill me!” Now, Mia has taken this funny interview to a whole new level, by using Ayesha’s over-share as a way to publicly flirt with the 28-year-old’s man! While some Twitter users LOLed at her tweet, the majority of responses to Mia’s message totally slammed her for trying to seduce a married man.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“No married man with a fine ass woman and a wonderful kid wants to smash an 8 who been ran through on camera,” one person wrote. Another added, “He’s married to a beautiful woman. You’ve been ran thru…on camera. Sit this one out,” while a third joked, “He’s married to @ayeshacurry, zero chance. Try&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nick Young</strong></a>.” LOL! Ayesha and Steph have yet to respond to Mia’s tweet.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>Sup, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@StephenCurry30</a>? <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/A2Qlx0cNe4</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>— Mia K.
