No one can replace him. <strong>Vanna White</strong>, she’s become a dear friend. I’m so much looking forward to being on stage with her. And I love the show and giving away cash and prizes.”</p><p class=p1>Seacrest announced in February that <a href=#>he was leaving <i>Live With Kelly and Ryan </i></a>with <strong>Kelly Ripa</strong>’s husband, <strong>Mark Consuelos</strong>, taking over his daytime seat. Several months later, Seacrest revealed that he will fill Sajek’s shoes as the <a href=#>next host of <i>Wheel of Fortune</i></a>. (After 41 seasons hosting the game show, Sajek, 77, plans to leave at the end of the 2023-2024 season in the summer. Seacrest will begin filming in September 2024.)</p><p class=p1>“I’m very excited about that and fortunately I signed a deal to stay on the radio with iHeartRadio for a few more years, so I will postpone retirement,” he quipped on <i>GMA</i>. “I thought after <i>Live With Kelly and Ryan </i>I was going to take a break, but why?”</p><p class=p1>Seacrest, who also is the host of <i>American Idol</i>, will next be seen emceeing <i>Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve </i>on Sunday, December 31. Since 2005, Seacrest has hosted the holiday broadcast for ABC live from Times Square. (He formally assumed the lead host role in 2013 after Dick Clark’s death.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ryan-seacrest-jokingly-says-he-plans-to-postpone-retirement-02.jpg><p class=p1>“I was a kid watching this show, watching other people do the things that I get a chance to do every day. Wanting to do it. And I feel like I’ve gotta prove that I’m worthy of doing it every single time,” Seacrest<a href=#> exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in December 2022. “I think that is part of what keeps it exciting for me too.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “We have three live countdowns in this show, which I never thought was even possible when I first started. But we’ve got [broadcasts in] Puerto Rico, Times Square and New Orleans, and we’ve also added another party on the West Coast. It’ll be L.A. as we always have a Disneyland [portion].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Sunday will be <a href=#>Seacrest’s 19th time ringing in the new year</a> on <i>Rockin’ Eve.</i></p><p class=p1>“The show goes past 1 a.m. but [there’s] the adrenaline rush,” he said on Friday. “So, you get out there, you pace yourself a little bit. We start at 8:00, so you’re pacing yourself, but there’s such a rush that runs through your body when you’re out there and to think about being under that ball at midnight. It’s such a bucket list opportunity that I get to do every year.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerSxwJypnqukYrewt8innqWxXaiuur%2BMoZxmqJyWu7R506hkqaejqb2wusRmqZ6smaeyrrHNrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-hennessy.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Hennessy</span></a>
