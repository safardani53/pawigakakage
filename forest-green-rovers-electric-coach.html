We’ve been waiting for electric buses to come into the world and they’re here now.</p><p>“We’re hoping to get one ourselves for the coming season and we’ll see how many games we can squeeze in with it, but it’s super-important that we electrify transport to reduce emissions and consumption of fossil fuels.”</p><p>Since coming into the Football League in 2017, Forest Green Rovers have made steady progress in becoming an established league side.</p><p>Vince said: “We’ve made steady progress since then which is what we aim to do, rather than boom and bust. And hopefully we do the same now."</p><p><a href=#>Forest Green's new Eco Park stadium</a> is projected to be double the size of New Lawn with a capacity for 12,000 supporters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FE7A3379.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ww_083.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ww_085sm.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ww_074.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NINTCHDBPICT000607599184.jpg><p>The plan for Vince is to have the stadium ready in three or four seasons, when they will need it most.</p><p>“Really the plan is to have it ready before we need it,” he added.</p><p>“We can stay where we are and survive in League One OK, it’ll be a stretch but we can manage it.
