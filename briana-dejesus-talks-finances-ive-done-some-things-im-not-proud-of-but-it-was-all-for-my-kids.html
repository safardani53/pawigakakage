She’s not as widely despised as Farrah Abraham or Jenelle Evans, nor is she as universally beloved as Chelsea Houska.
Some viewers admire Briana’s outspoken demeanor, while others think she stirs the pot unnecessarily.
Some say she delights in drama, while others note that her combative nature makes for quality TV."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I prayed for this.</p><p>“Generational wealth is my end goal,” Briana continued.</p><p>“Leaving my kids with everything so they don’t have to struggle like we did. I love my kids more than anything!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Briana went on to reveal that while her new home is nothing fancy — she might be throwing some subtle shade at her longtime rival, <a href=#>Kailyn Lowry, who recently built a mansion</a> — it represents a brighter future for herself and her kids.</p><p>“It may not be a mansion, I may not have that white picket fence dream with a big family every girl dreams about but I’m the first woman in my family to own multiple homes without needing help from a man (no offense),” DeJesus wrote.</p><p>“I will continue to work hard for my kids bc they deserve it! I want to give them everything I didn’t get to have during my childhood,” she added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I suffered quietly and kept it pushing bc I knew I had to get to the end goal.”</p><p>Briana went on to say that the house is the culmination of a plan that she began shortly after she became famous.</p><p>“I made plans and conquered them within 6 years. I know God was always in my corner even during the rough times. I know he is always looking out for me,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“Some of y’all will say- it’s just a house but to me, it’s more than that,” she added.</p><p>“It’s proof to never give up. Anyways, cheers to 2023! I can’t wait to make new memories with my kids here! And I also can’t wait to see where we will be in another 6 years!”</p><p>Briana obviously has every reason to be proud of herself.</p><p>And the best part of all of this is the example that she’s setting for her daughters.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WAcK7RopinmV2Zsqux0q6qZqyRobi0ecWipZqmk5rAbrXVnmSdp56aerS7zJ5kraCZo7S0ecimZKenpGK9s7vUnWSonl2XwrV5yK1ksJmjYq6tuIyfpqtlna56rLXDrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./phillip-thompson.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Phillip Thompson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
