The Simple Life alum has already chosen a name for her future daughter.</p><p>“We’re planning it already,” the former reality star, 39, said on the Tuesday, September 15, episode of the “LadyGang” podcast. “First one is going to be a boy and girl twin. When you freeze your eggs, you can pick if you get a boy, you get a girl [or] you get twins.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Paris-Hilton-Reveals-Name-She-Has-Already-Chosen-for-Future-Boy-Girl-Twins.jpg><p>The New York native went on to say, “I have baby London, which is the girl, and I’m trying to figure out a name for the boy. So if you have any suggestions, I’m asking my friends. I don’t want a theme of cities, but I don’t know — it’s hard to decide. London for sure for the girl; the boy, I’m just still trying to decide on.”</p><p>Last month, Hilton opened up about her pregnancy plans, telling Britain’s Sunday Times that she had been “inspired” by <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> </a>to freeze her eggs.</p><p>“I think every woman should do it because you can really control it and not have that ‘Oh, my God, I need to get married’ [mindset],” the DJ explained to the outlet in August. “I’m obsessed with dressing them up. I want twins, because then you get [a girl and a boy] at once.”</p><p>The socialite, who added that she wants “a minj-me,” is “not pregnant yet, but definitely <a href=#>trying</a>,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly that same month.</p><p>“She has matured a lot and really wants to settle down and start a family,” the insider revealed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Paris-Hilton-and-Carter-Reum-Paris-Hilton-Reveals-Name-She-Has-Already-Chosen-for-Future-Boy-Girl-Twins.jpg><p>The model’s sister, <a href=#><strong>Nicky Hilton</strong></a>, thinks that Paris will be an “incredible mother” one day, exclusively explaining to Us in October 2019: “She is like a big kid herself. … [My daughters] just think she’s, like, a doll. When she visits New York, I’ll take them over to her loft, and they’ll just look at her dolls and her trinkets and her figurines and then the little dogs, and they just are in heaven.”</p><p>Paris is currently dating <strong>Carter Reum</strong>. She and the entrepreneur, 39, <a href=#>celebrated their first anniversary</a> in April. “My favorite thing to do is make memories with you,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “Your kisses are magical. I love being yours and knowing you’re mine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapmaKewG60yKWrqKZdp7K3scClqmamkaKybr%2FHnmScoJ%2Bosm6yzqtkn62kqr%2BmecGosGafmae5bsDWoqWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angie-harmon-jokes-about-boobs-sitting-on-stomach-high-waisted-pant-trends-8410806.html><span>←</span><span>Angie Harmon Shares Her Very Honest Review on High-Waisted Jeans (Exclusive)</span></a>
