The&nbsp;answer to that is he is a gay man.</p><p>Starrr was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a>&nbsp;on November 11, 1989, in Orlando, Florida. Speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a>, he revealed he realized his sexuality at the age of 12. As a frightened 12-year-old who was clueless about how to convey his feelings to his family;&nbsp;he started&nbsp;experimenting with makeup, standing in front of his mother's&nbsp;mirror. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I started dealing with my feelings in front of the mirror in my mother's bathroom. That was the start of&nbsp;Patrick Starrr.</p><p>In another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with the BBC, the YouTube star admitted he identified&nbsp;himself "as a gay man." He stated he does not perform as a drag queen.</p><p>The 31-years-old also explained that he wore make-up to gain the trust of his&nbsp;potential customers and make them believe he was a&nbsp;good make-up artist.&nbsp;</p><p>Would you want to go to a dentist with no teeth?&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Loves to Spend Time with Family</h2><p>The talented makeup artist was born to an entrepreneur <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">father</a> and nurse mother.
