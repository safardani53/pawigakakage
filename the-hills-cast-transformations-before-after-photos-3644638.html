The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>cast members</a> were all young adults when the show first aired in 2006, and now, many of them are grown up with families! Several of the show’s stars returned for the reboot, The Hills: New Beginnings, in 2019, but it’s still pretty unbelievable to look back and see how much they’ve changed from the beginning of the series to now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Perhaps the biggest transformation was from <strong>Spencer Pratt</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Heidi Montag</strong> — they were prone to causing major drama when&nbsp;The Hills first aired, but they’ve totally settled down and are now happily married with a son. Meanwhile, some of the work Heidi’s had done on her face has worn off over the years, giving her a much more natural look these days. Of course, she’s still drastically different than when she first appeared on the show as a fresh-faced teenager!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong> has always had a natural beauty about her, but she’s definitely also matured since her first years on the show. She stepped away from the spotlight after&nbsp;The Hills ended and has settled down with her husband and two sons.&nbsp;<strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong> also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>didn’t return</a> for&nbsp;The Hills: New Beginnings, but she still has her own reality show,&nbsp;Very Cavallari, and is happily married with three kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/spencer-pratt-and-heidi-montag-hills-transformation-1-embed.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lauren-conrad-the-hills-then-now-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Other cast members, like <strong>Brody Jenner, Audrina Patridge, </strong><strong>Stephanie Pratt, Frankie Delgado,</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Justin “Bobby” Bresica</strong> and more have changed quite a bit over the years, as well.
