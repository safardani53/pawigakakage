Over the course of the 1970s, Robbie, who was also known as Robin or Rob, played an integral role in Bachman–Turner Overdrive's biggest years in music by creating drum tracks for some of their biggest songs and defining the band's aesthetic.</p><p>Unfortunately, news broke on Jan. 12, 2023, that Robbie had died at 69 years old. With that being said, what exactly was his cause of death? Let's take a closer look.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Robbie Bachman's cause of death?</h2><p>Randy Bachman, Robbie's brother and bandmate, confirmed the news of his death on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> on the evening of Jan. 12, 2023.</p><p>"Another sad departure. The pounding beat behind BTO, my little brother Robbie has joined Mum, Dad & brother Gary on the other side. Maybe <a href=#>Jeff Beck</a> needs a drummer! He was an integral cog in our rock 'n' roll machine and we rocked the world together," Randy wrote to his followers.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, Robbie's exact cause of death has not been confirmed.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, Robbie and Randy grew up in Winnipeg, Canada, and developed a love for music from a young age. Randy formed the group Brave Belt around this time, and when Robbie turned 18 his brother offered him the job of being the band's drummer. By 1973, Brave Belt became Bachman-Turner Overdrive and Robbie was instrumental in designing the band's now-famous "gear" logo.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>As Bachman-Turner Overdrive's fame grew, so did Robbie's involvement. He is actually credited with co-writing one of the group's biggest hit songs: "Roll on down the Highway" (with Fred Turner). Robbie remained a member of the group up until late 1979 after the conclusion of their "Rock n' Roll Nights" tour. In 1984, Robbie declined to rejoin the group due to licensing issues.</p><p>However, from 1988 to 1991, Robbie rejoined the group for the "Not Fragile" line-up of Bachman-Turner Overdrive. Things fell out after that, with Robbie eventually suing his brother in an effort to prevent him and bandmate Fred Turner from touring under the name Bachman-Turner Overdrive in the 2010s. In the years that followed, Robbie lived semi-retired alongside his wife, Chrissy.</p><p>Our thoughts are with Robbie's family, friends, and fans during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjrsieZJuZk526orqMnJiuq5VivKd5w56YraA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-tim-griffin-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Tim Griffin Dating Now</span></a>
