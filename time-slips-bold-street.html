I turned around and as I looked up Bold Street, I saw about 12 or 13 people walking by all dressed in 1940s coats and hats.&nbsp;</p><p>“And what was even more significant was on the day it happened in June 1996, it was warm and I was wearing a T-shirt and jeans - but the people on the street seemed to be in the cold.”</p><p>Julie claims she was then startled by the sound of an old-fashioned car with round side mirrors honking its horn as it hurtled towards her, despite the street being pedestrianised.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE FEATURES">READ MORE FEATURES</h2><p>She headed inside the shop, where a woman in 1940s-style clothing was manning the till and shaking her head at her.</p><p>“It had old-fashioned, mahogany display cabinets, and everything was dark, which is odd because shops are normally bright,” adds Julie.</p><p>“Then suddenly I saw a bookcase with Dillons written on it, and a man grabbed my arm, and I was back in 1996.”</p><p>Julie believes she experienced a phenomenon known as a ‘time slip’, where people claim they were suddenly transported backwards - and forwards - in time to the same spot.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/headquarters-liverpool-gas-company-radiant-867488305.jpg><p>It sounds like something out of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> show <a href=#>Manifest</a> or <a href=#>Doctor Who</a>, but the internet is awash with so-called time slippers’ experiences.</p><p><a href=#>Danny Robins</a>, who hosts the Uncanny podcast and BBC series of the same name, which explores people’s experiences of paranormal phenomena, says they are not uncommon and highly intriguing.</p><p>“I received a great story about somebody who walked out of the Oxford Street branch of <a href=#>HMV</a> in the 1990s and saw the London street as it was in the Victorian period,” he tells The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>“They witnessed horse drawn carriages and cobbled streets and even experienced the smells of Victorian <a href=#>London</a>.</p><p>“How do you explain that? Is it a glitch in someone’s mind? Or is it a moment of the past genuinely coming back to life in a strange sensory way?&nbsp;</p><p>“The idea of a connection to the past is really intriguing. We’d all love to travel back in time like in Back to the Future.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/danny-robins-attends-press-night-867486372.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/general-view-hmv-flagship-store-867487093.jpg><p>Bold Street, where Julie claims she had her first paranormal encounter, is said to be a hotbed of time slip encounters.</p><p>She wasn’t alone that day - an off-duty policeman called Frank was heading into the bookshop to meet his wife Carol and also claimed to witness the flashback to the 1940s, with spooky echoes of Julie’s account.</p><p>Julie claims she experienced subsequent time slips - the first one being nine months later, again in Liverpool, where she worked for <a href=#>ITV</a>’s <a href=#>This Morning</a>, then filmed at the Albert Docks.</p><p>She was heading to the Abbey National bank on North John Street in her lunch break when she found herself entering a shop adjacent, full of baby clothes.&nbsp;</p><p>“I remember grabbing a little grey knitted cardigan, but when I looked up there was a sign saying 2d - two pence in old money - and everyone was dressed in 1960s clothes,” she recalls.</p><p>She says the experience was much quicker than the Bold Street one and things returned to normal as she headed back up the street.</p><p>A few years later she had another brief time slip encounter, this time on a train near Waverley Station in<a href=#> Edinburgh</a>. She felt it slow down and assumed they were arriving at the station, but when she went to the door the carriage suddenly looked different.</p><p>“There had been lots of people onboard, but then there were only maybe three people, I could only see the backs of their heads, and the carriage looked older,” she says.</p><p>“I peered out the door and was shocked to see a station that was really old and everyone was dressed in early 1900s clothes.”</p><p>Unnerved by the experiences, Julie even went to see renowned British psychic <a href=#>Derek Acorah</a> who told her that she might have one foot in this dimension and another in a different one.&nbsp;</p><p>He got her to try to do a ‘close off’, where she imagined a purple cloak covering her from top to bottom, with the intention of ‘closing her third eye’. She felt safe for a while after, but has had other little slips since.</p><p>Julie thinks there’s a connection between the fact she is always in a hurry when experiencing the time slips, and the train systems.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s a theory online that time shifts are linked with the trains and underground rail system, which shake time,” she says. “Everywhere I’ve had the slips there’s been train lines.”</p><p>One of the most well known ‘time slips’ is the Moberly-Jourdain incident in 1911, in which Charlotte Moberly and Eleanor Jourdain claimed to have seen the <a href=#>Versailles Palace</a> gardens as they were in the late 18th century, as well as ghosts, including Marie Antoinette.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/petit-trianon-place-queen-marie-867502072.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/newspress-collage-p8c0tihas-1703090895100.jpg><p>Another is the story of Harry Martindale, who in 1953 while working as an apprentice plumber was doing a job in the cellar of the Treasurer’s House in York.&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed he was standing on his ladder on a section of an old Roman road when he looked down and witnessed a procession of Roman soldiers on foot and horseback looking weary, miserable and dirty, shuffling along like an undisciplined rabble.</p><p>Alan Murdie, chairman of The Ghost Club - the oldest organisation in the world associated with psychical research - tells The Sun: “I met Harry in 1981 and he told me that story.</p><p>"Interestingly there was subsequent research by a guy called Ian Wilson who wrote a book called In Search of Ghosts, in which he indicates other people at the Treasurer’s House had also seen these Roman soldiers.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Murdie believes time slips are visions rather than people actually travelling back in time.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t believe this is some kind of Tardis experience,” he adds.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000867482287.jpg><p>“I think they’re having a vision of the past in the way that some people have the ability to look into the future.”</p><p>Carl Grove, who has a keen interest in time slips and has written a research paper on unusual incidents in the village of Rougham, Suffolk, tells The Sun about a recent potential time slip he claims he experienced when on holiday in Hemsby, Norfolk.</p><p>“About halfway through the small caravan site I saw an old rusting caravan that stood out amongst the new well-kept ones. It looked as if a half-hearted attempt had been made to tidy up the furnishings before its abandonment,” he recalls.&nbsp;</p><p>“Then a few yards further on, I saw a 1950s style gents toilet with an entrance facing the caravans and steps leading down to a gloomy interior.&nbsp;</p><p>“The next time I went that way a few days later there was no sign of either caravan or toilet!”</p><p>People have also spoken online about time slipping into the future. One claimed to witness a hover vehicle with no wheels drive past on the road and a load of people in futuristic clothes inside staring back in surprise.</p><p>Robins has been inundated with people’s time slip stories and thinks the accounts seem genuine.&nbsp;</p><p>“People believe that they went to these various streets and locations and were transported in time,” he says.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“They could see and feel everything, whether it’s horse and carts or shops from the 1940s.
