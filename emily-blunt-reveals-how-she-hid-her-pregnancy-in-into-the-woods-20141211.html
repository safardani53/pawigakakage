I would say towards the end, every four or five days they were making some adjustments.”</p><p>The wardrobe department wasn’t the only one that had to make adjustments, though. Blunt also had to warn her costar <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Pine</a></strong>, with whom she has a dance scene in the film.</p><p>“When we did rehearsals, I was being kind of careful,” she recalled to Disney twenty-three. “By the time we shot, it was about two months later and I said to Chris Pine, ‘You need to add 15 pounds to what you felt before. When you dip me, you gotta get yourself in a deep lunge because there’s more weight coming down!'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Those logistics aside, Blunt’s pregnancy turned out to be a boon for her during filming. “The fact that I was pregnant actually was a rather transporting thing, and a very helpful experience in a way to understanding the urgent need that this woman has for a baby,” she explained. “Here I was, feeling incredibly blessed and understanding what the character maybe is missing out on.”</p><p>The Golden Globe winner and her husband, actor <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Krasinski</a></strong>, welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Hazel, back in February. “She was like…just perfect,” Blunt told <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a></strong> a few months later.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaepZmhxm6uy66lrWWimsOmrcusZKGnp2LAqbGMoaCdZZiav2680Z6ep5memMZutc1moKesn2LBqbGMsKaonKNif3F9k2ppamlf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dana-gould-19640824-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dana Gould (Comedian) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
