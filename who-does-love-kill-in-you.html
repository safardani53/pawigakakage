Now that we’re fully invested in Netflix's Season 3 of You, we want to know how evil Love really is. For some unexplainable reason, we understand every move she makes even though we’d never make those moves ourselves (hopefully)."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

With Season 3 now here, who does she kill in ‘You’ in total?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>Spoiler alert: This article contains major spoilers for Seasons 2 and 3 of </strong><strong>You</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Now that we’re fully invested in <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s Season 3 of <a href=#>You</a>, we want to know how evil Love really is. For some unexplainable reason, we understand every move she makes even though we’d never make those moves ourselves (hopefully). <a href=#>We like Love</a>, even though she’s a killer. And although we hoped her killing spree would end by Season 3, it hasn't.</p><p>In fact, Love is behind the first couple of murders in <a href=#>You Season 3</a>, as well as some from her past that we learned about in the Season 2 finale. So, who does <a href=#>Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti)</a> kill in You, and why does she kill them?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sofia, the au pair</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>When they were growing up, twins Love and Forty (James Scully) had an au pair whom we find out had abused and sexually assaulted Forty. Forty thinks that he unknowingly killed Sofia, but we later see a flashback in the Season 2 finale in which Love slits Sofia’s throat.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">James Kennedy, Love’s former husband</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Although in Season 2 we believe that <a href=#>Love’s former husband, James</a> (Daniel Durant), died from cancer, we find out more in Season 3. Love’s mother suspects that Love might have killed James, and as it turns out, she’s right. James wanted to leave Love, so in an effort to make him stay, Love drugs James with wolfsbane, but messes up the dosage and accidentally kills him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Delilah Alves, Joe’s neighbor</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Unbeknownst to us, Love is on her way to discovering Joe’s secrets. What's most unsettling: They don’t bother her at all. In fact, she wants to protect him at all costs … So in Season 2 when she finds <a href=#>Delilah (Carmela Zumbado)</a> trapped in Joe’s basement, she kills her to protect Joe’s secrets. Joe thinks he did it in a drug-fueled trip, but we soon learn that it was Love (literally and metaphorically) behind the murder.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Candace Stone, Joe’s ex-girlfriend</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In Season 1, we all think that Joe killed his ex-girlfriend <a href=#>Candace (Ambyr Childers)</a>, and not for lack of trying.</p><p>But in Season 2, she basically comes back from the dead and ingratiates herself into the Quinn family’s inner circle. Candace traps Joe in his vault to get back at him, but Love is fully in Joe’s corner already. Instead of siding with Candace to take down the serial killer, Love kills Candace herself (finishing what Joe started).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Natalie Engler, Joe and Love’s neighbor</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Season 3 welcomes a new Joe and Love, who vow to only do good to protect their son, Henry. However, when Love discovers Joe’s box of obsessions surrounding their next-door neighbor <a href=#>Natalie (Michaela McManus)</a>, Love gets into a fit of impulsive rage. Only Love should be Joe’s obsession, so in a moment of weakness, Love ax-murders Natalie in the basement of Love’s future bakery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gil, a noble father of two</h2><p><a href=#>Gil (Mackenzie Astin)</a> comes into Love’s bakery in Season 3 after hearing that she and Joe’s son, Henry, was almost fatally ill with the measles. Gil nobly admits that Henry must have caught the measles from his unvaccinated daughters.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Gil's death is unlike the rest. Love and Joe lock Gil in the glass cage in the basement bakery. Instead of letting him go, they search for dark information from his past to blackmail him and protect themselves.</p><p>In doing so, they discover that Gil’s son is a sexual assaulter and that his wife paid off the women to cover it up. When Gil finds this out, he takes his own life. Although Love doesn’t directly kill Gil, she’s arguably responsible for his death.</p><p>Love’s body count may not be quite up to Joe’s, but six murders isn’t nothing … and that’s all the murders we’re aware of. For all we know, there could be even more.</p><p>Season 3 of You is now available to stream on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOonKxlnKTDpnnKoqOlZZmjerq71A%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7qs6o8zpo4yqlbaal9sycygmmcqiqj68.html><span>←</span><span>Stream Movies, Shows &amp;amp; Live TV</span></a>
