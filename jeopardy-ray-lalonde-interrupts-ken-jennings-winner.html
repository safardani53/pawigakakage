Ken replied in surprise and a light flurry of impatience.</p><p>"Here Comes Santa Claus," Ray sang in reply - which was the correct response though too late for it to be counted.</p><p>"The kids were saying 'Here Comes Santa Claus'" Ken smiled and assured, then moving on.</p><p>Ken revealed Ray bet $9,600, leaving him with $10,500 and the winner, while Kim was a mere $700 short with $9,800 - Jason bet big and was left with $800.</p><h2>'SWAY' TO GO!</h2><p>Fans were thrilled that Ray pulled through as one wrote on Reddit: "My man Ray giving quite a scare!"</p><p>"Excellent show" wrote another as a third agreed: "I would think both Kim and Jason would be in the producers' minds for Second Chance Tournament."</p><p>A fourth wrote: "Another reason to study wagering theory because Jason cost himself a win by not betting 0."</p><p>"Also weird wagering from Kim," though only contestants can know what it feels like to be up there.</p><p>Ray designs sets for movies and TV shows, revealing tonight he just wrapped on Hulu's Handmaid's Tale.</p><p><a href=#>Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;viewers have been impressed by his chops but have taken to various online forums to vent about his winning moves in a more literal sense.</p><p>As the contestant responds to clues and keeps winning, he's also constantly swaying back and forth.</p><p>On the show's podcast Inside Jeopardy on Monday,&nbsp;<a href=#>longtime producer Sarah Foss</a>&nbsp;acknowledged the show is aware of his swaying too: "Ray, He kind of likes to move back and forth during his gameplay."</p><p>"Which is difficult for our camera operators."</p><p>"So he may or may not have gotten the nickname 'Ray the Sway.'"</p><p>"But Ray, however it is you like to win Jeopardy!, you do you!"</p><p>According to <a aria-label="TBS News Watch (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TBS News Watch</a>, the reasoning behind <a href=#>Ray's swaying</a> is more than justified, it's due to a medical ailment.</p><p>The outlet wrote: "He suffered some spinal cord&nbsp;damage over a period of years, and had to work hard to prevent muscle spasms in his legs while he was on camera."</p><p><a href=#>The father-of-one also won over fans&nbsp;</a>on Monday's show when he wildly revealed that he's a twin and his sibling is "in the process of auditioning for Jeopardy! right now."</p><p>He joked: "There's a chance you're gonna be seeing this face again and again."</p><p>Ken questioned: "Have you guys considered just swapping in and out during your run without telling us?"</p><p>Ray quipped back: "How do you know we're not?"</p><p>The show's host laughed before joking: "We're going to have to start fingerprinting before every game."</p><h2>MOVING ON UP</h2><p>Ray will go for his fifth win tomorrow night and his arrival is a sigh of relief for Jeopardy! fans who like winning streaks.</p><p>Nearly midway through the season which ends this summer, only three contestants before tonight had enough wins to qualify for next year's Tournament of Champions.</p><p>Those would be Cris, who amassed the 5th longest earnings in history with $748K until he shockingly lost out of nowhere, <a href=#>Luigi de Guzman</a>, and priest <a href=#>David Sibley.</a></p><p>Last week, <a href=#>Sean McShane</a> - who <a href=#>insulted Long Island</a> - got close with three but then <a href=#>lost to Ray.</a></p><p>So now there are four players eligible for next year's competition, which is nothing if not good news.</p><p>The 2022 Tournament of Champions had 19 contestants eligible with 4+ wins (and two from the new Second Chance competition).</p><p>The stacked lineup for the ages included winner <a href=#>Amy Schneider</a> (40 prior victories) <a href=#>Mattea Roach</a> (23 victories), <a href=#>Matt Amodio</a> (38 victories) and <a href=#>Ryan Long</a> (16 victories) from that season.</p><p>It was so packed with power players that the game show even did a <a href=#>one-off episode with the three top stars</a> that didn't count, just so they could flex.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Over the summer,&nbsp;Ken and actress&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late longtime host, Alex Trebek.</a></p><p>The hosting announcement hasn't been the only big move for Jeopardy!, as executive producer&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;- who replaced the ousted Mike Richards - filled a job that before them,&nbsp;<a href=#>hadn't changed hands</a>&nbsp;in decades either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/s-ken-jennings-gets-cut-784196157.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/s-ken-jennings-gets-cut-784196156.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/champ-cris-pannullo-loses-21-781140195-8.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaWqGd4GRaKGep6CWv6XFjKuYsmWclrmwusOeZKKmpJq%2Fs8HPrapmo5Wjequxzaegp5%2BjYsSqus2eqWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyssa-logan-tarek-el-moussa-dated-nanny-christina-split.html><span>←</span><span>Dated His Nanny During Christina Split Hollywood Life</span></a>
