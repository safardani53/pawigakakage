Chang's. Specifically, the Atlanta Airport P.F. Chang's. Why anyone would want to work at a restaurant at an airport is beyond us — but to each their own.&nbsp;</p><p>“I did fill out an application at P.F. Chang’s at the Atlanta Airport because I think it’s one of the best places,” he said. “It looks like they are having the best time.”</p><p>We're sure that the employees at that P.F. Chang's would think otherwise, but it's nice to know that he wants to contribute to the environment of one of his favorite places. Though, showing up to P.F. Chang's and having Bill Murray as your server would sure make the experience much more exciting.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bill, you're hired!
