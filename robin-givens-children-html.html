Her relationship with legendary boxer <a href=# rel=follow>Mike Tyson</a> made a lot of headlines, and she was the target of a lot of criticism. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>However, in all the difficulties, her children were her saving grace. She found the most happiness in and around them.</p><p>The loves of her life are now all grown up, but she still shares great moments with them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>About Robin Givens'&nbsp;Children</h2><p>Givens has <a href=# rel="follow noopener">two children</a>. Her first son, Michael Givens, more commonly known&nbsp;as Buddy, is adopted.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ez-10 class=ez-video-placeholder-marker></span><p>She adopted Buddy in 1993. He was born on October 14, 1992, and she adopted him shortly after.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>In 1992, she gave a phenomenal performance in Boomerang. But, even though her career was doing good, she walked away from it all, along with her son. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In 1995, she moved to a small town outside Hilton Head, South Carolina, and lived in relative privacy. She focused on being a mother instead, for a while.</p><p>Then, in 1999, Givens welcomed her second son, William Givens Jensen, who everyone knows as Billy, with ex-boyfriend Murphy Jensen. He was born on September 10, 1999.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Robin Givens with her children, sons Buddy (left) and Billy (right).</strong> (Photo: Robin Givens/<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>Givens then moved back to New York after Billy was born. But the family did not remain there for long.</p><p>Following a few months in New York, she again moved her family, this time to a place near Tampa Bay, Florida. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>There, she wanted Buddy&nbsp;to be enrolled in a top tennis club. And she began her healing process, much of which came from her relationship with Tyson.</p><p>She had a miscarriage when she was with Tyson, something he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">doubted all along</a>.</p><h2>Robin Givens's Children Helped Her Heal</h2><p>After moving to Florida, Givens devoted a lot of time to overcoming&nbsp;the hurt and grief from her past. And her children helped her on that journey.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking to Wendy Williams</a> in November 2018, she talked about how she spent a lot of time being a mother and not focusing on other things.</p><p>However, she said that nothing had made her happier than being with her kids and that they were the best remedies to her pain.</p><p>Givens also gushed about how Billy had just started college, which&nbsp;meant more time for herself and less time worrying about them.</p><p>She now shows off her grown-up sons on her Instagram, posting pictures with them regularly, with long captions showing her love, appreciation, and pride. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Who Is Robin Givens'&nbsp;Kids' Father?</h2><p>As stated above, Givens' first kid is adopted. However, she wanted both her kids to have a father.</p><p>Givens'&nbsp;life has been plagued with short relationships and bad marriages. That trend began with her marriage to Tyson.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=follow>Riverdale actress</a> and Tyson began dating in 1987 and married on February 7, 2088. However, their marriage failed because of his alleged physical and sexual abuse. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She filed for divorce only eight months into their relationship in October 1988, after her miscarriage in June 1988. After many back and forth alleging fake&nbsp;pregnancy and defamation, their divorce was finalized on February 14, 1989.</p><p>She had such a horrible time with Tyson that she <a href=# rel=follow>refused to partake</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;his biopic.</p><p>The actress was into tennis at the time. And she was learning the game from tennis coach Svetozar Marinkovic. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, their relationship progressed into something more than just trainer-trainee, and they had their wedding on August 22, 1997.</p><p>However, they separated just a day later. She filed for divorce from him just&nbsp;months later, on December 19 that same year. Their separation was made official on September 23, 1998.</p><p>Then, she started dating Jensen, a tennis player. It's not sure when they broke up. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In around 2007, she was dating an older gentleman and wanted a husband, too. "I want my children to have a father. I want a husband," she confessed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Essence</a>.</p><p>She wasn't willing to make any compromises, though. And it seems like she's sticking by her words until now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqfl7avecairZ6mo2KwqbXLnamepl6dwa64</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paulina-goto-19910729-html.html><span>←</span><span>Paulina Goto (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
