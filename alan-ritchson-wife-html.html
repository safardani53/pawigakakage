However, it seems Alan always had a hunger to make it to Hollywood because, after his failed attempt at the singing competition, he starred in CW’s drama&nbsp;Smallville as&nbsp;Arthur Curry.&nbsp;

She is a producer and writer, and together the couple has their own production company called AllyCat Entertainment. Here are five facts about Catherine.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>1. Mother of 3 kids</h2><p>Catherine and Alan have 3 sons. Their first son, Calem Ritchson, was born in 2012, and the&nbsp;second,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Edan Ritchson, was born in early&nbsp;2014. A year later, on&nbsp;December 6,&nbsp;the duo&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">welcomed their 3rd child</a>, son Amory Tristan.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The couple regularly posts about their kids on Instagram, and when their third son entered the world, the proud parents took to Instagram to share that their son’s name meant “brave and powerful.”</p><h2>2. Married for 15 years</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The duo got married in 2006, and on May 13 this year, Alan wrote a long and heartfelt tribute to Catherine on his Instagram post in honor of their 15th wedding anniversary.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the caption, the&nbsp;Hunger Games actor&nbsp;recounted&nbsp;their past and everything, from the highs to the lows they went through as a couple,&nbsp;and noted they&nbsp;would continue to be by each other's side as they go through life.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Giving Up Alcohol</h2><p>One of the lows Alan was referring to was probably Catherine’s battle with sobriety. Catherine has never shied away from talking about her struggle with alcohol on Instagram.</p><p>On September 29, 2019, the producer uploaded a post on Instagram and recounted her journey to becoming sober for a year. In the lengthy caption, she even advised others who were considering going alcohol-free not to be caught up with cultural expectations and go for it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>4. Fitness Fanatic&nbsp;</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Besides giving up alcohol, Catherine and her husband are keen on staying healthy and always in great shape. The couple works out together, evidenced by his and her dumbbells that Catherine uploaded on her Instagram.&nbsp;</p><p>Alan, who has an enviable physique, revealed in an Instagram post that putting in the hard work was the key to getting fit.&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Serving the Community&nbsp;</h2><p>Catherina and Alan are also great role models. The duo serves as&nbsp;members of the Heart and Armor organization.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">organization’s website</a>, they “aim to protect the health of veterans and to connect civilians to the experience of military service.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmclrtuvsitmqGrn6N6uLXFnmWhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylan-michael-seaman-lfnj-html.html><span>←</span><span>Taylan Michael Seaman (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
