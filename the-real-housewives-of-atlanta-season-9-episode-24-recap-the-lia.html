Kandi noted that Phaedra has been playing a game with Porsha all season long and it’s not been healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>Porsha bursts in floods of tears, while Kandi looked like she was ready to forgive her. These lies have cast a dark shadow over the latter part of the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody likes having their name dragged through the mud, but poor Kandi had that done to her and people questioned whether it was true.&nbsp;</p><p>Porsha continued to try and make things right with Kandi.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/porsha-williams-smiling-1024x1002.jpg><p>“That’s awful. I would never say that about somebody if you didn’t tell me that.”</p><p>Phaedra&nbsp;just sat on the seat, not giving a damn about the way she was being portrayed on television.&nbsp;</p><p>The issue at hand quickly switched to whether Phaedra created the rumor from thin air, or if one of the other housewives said it first.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, what the women did to Kandi was beyond horrible, and, they did it on national TV! That would be enough to make anyone want to run off and change their name.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the women started wailing, and it became clear just how much of an effect this had on all of them. While Porsha&nbsp;questioned her whole friendship with Phaedra, Todd Tucker had the best response.&nbsp;</p><p>“Drag her Porsha!”</p><p>Porsha then had the mother of all responses when she realized Phaedra was trying to play dumb about the whole thing.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/kandi-burruss-at-2017-grammy-awards.jpg><p>“You know damn well the day you told me that, two days before I sat with Kandi, you said she told you firsthand! Then two days ago we talked on the phone, and you told me that she said it firsthand. Now, what I’m not gonna do is go back in text messages and reveal that, because we don’t need no motherf—ing receipts.”</p><p>I was sitting there, waiting to see the receipts. Now, I love a good feud, but not when one person is this crappy towards someone who is a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>When the tables turned on Phaedra, she tried to brush it all off, saying: “I asked her. I said, ‘I was told this.’”</p><p>Um, alright then.&nbsp;</p><p>When Andy pushed for the truth from Porsha, she could only muster the same rehashed response she had already given, like, ten times.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was repeating something. I shouldn’t have repeated it.”</p><p>Kandi, however, was not ready to let the feud die down.&nbsp;</p><p>“Y’all accused me of being a f—ing rapist!”</p><p>This signaled the ladies to take a break from all of the drama and left the stage. When they returned, Phaedra pulled a new phrase from her vocabulary:&nbsp;</p><p>“You know I made a rash decision.”</p><p>For what it’s worth, she did try to apologize, but she also never admitted she was in the wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy then even targeted Phaedra because he felt like she was giving the women a bad name.&nbsp;</p><p>“You got caught in a pretty megawatt lie. I don’t know that you’ve completely copped to it…”</p><p>Phaedra, however, was not ready to end the feud. She did try to apologize, but what is an apology when it almost ruined a life?</p><p>“All I can do is apologize. I can’t change that it happened.”</p><p>Oh, the drama.&nbsp;</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta returns later this year. Should Phaedra be fired?&nbsp;</p><p>Hit the comments!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>14 Shadiest Real Housewives Hook-Ups of All-Time</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WCcMDHnmSrnZGheqm71KycsKGmmsBuu8VmmK2kkaPBonnSnpisp55ihm6xz6KqqJyVYn91edGempqoXam1pnnLopho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheryl-crow-whats-in-my-bag.html><span>←</span><span>Sheryl Crow: Whats in My Bag?</span></a>
