On Sunday night, Kim released a series of Snapchat videos that actually depicted the phone call between her husband and Swift over the song, “Famous.”
If you’ll recall, there’s a lyric in that Kanye track that refers to Swift as a “bitch” and another that says perhaps he and his former rival could still have “sex” some time."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Of course I wanted to like the song.</strong></p><p><strong>I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship.
