Some reported hitting their palm against the right touchpad as the reason for the glitch or that it miraculously appears during gameplay. It's a mixed bag on how exactly it starts. But one fix that appears to work for numerous users is turning the FPS monitor on and off.</p><p>To do this, slide the performance overlay level from "Off" to "Level 4." You'll go back and forth multiple times, which users say will take a while before it eventually disables the information on your screen. If the glitch is still there, turn off the "Show Perf Overlay in Steam" option at the bottom of the performance overlay tab and try again.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It works like a charm, but you may run into an issue where you can't move the slider either. There's a fix for this one, as well. First, reboot the Steam Deck, then pull up the performance overlay.</p><p>If you have control over the slider again, move it to "Level 4." Reboot the portable device once again. When it hums back to life, the screen should be clear of performance information. Overall, restarting the Steam Deck can play a big part in resolving the situation, but only to adjust the performance overlay slider and eventually get rid of the data.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqMGmrcxmm56bm2K9pr7FqKmmmZ6Ysm671Z6ppZmpYsC1wcKk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-radcliffe-girlfriend-erin-darke-expecting-1st-child.html><span>←</span><span>Daniel Radcliffe, Girlfriend Erin Darke Expecting 1st Child</span></a>
