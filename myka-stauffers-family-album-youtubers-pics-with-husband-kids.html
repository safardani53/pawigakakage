Over the last year has been the more intense therapy to try and help him as much as possible. For us, it’s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals. A lot of their feedback [has been] really upsetting for us, because it’s not what we ever wanted to hear. We never wanted to be in this position, and we’ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.”</p><p>Myka chimed in, “Do I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500 percent. To when I get insidious, hurtful comments, it just, like, really makes it hurt worse. It’s not about me at all, but … the last couple of months have been the hardest thing I could’ve ever imagined.”</p><p>While the pair were bashed via social media for their decision with the hashtag #CancelMykaStauffer trending on Twitter, some of the mommy blogger’s followers came to her defense.</p><p>“I respect you so much for having the courage to make such a heartbreaking and hard decision,” one tweeted. “You are such great parents, you have to do what’s right for him first and foremost. You are brave and he will thrive in life because of you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Myka and James met on OKCupid and tied the knot in July 2014.
