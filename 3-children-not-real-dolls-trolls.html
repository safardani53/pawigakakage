I do love high street shops, but there is much less stock due to the affordable prices.</p><p>"I have spent thousands on baby clothes, however there are people in the community who have way more than me as they have been collecting for longer.</p><p>"Reborn dolls have a huge price range, the more realistic they are, the more expensive they are.</p><p>"Out of my three, Brynn was the most expensive as she's a long sold-out limited-edition kit.</p><p>"My parents have always known about my interest in dolls, so it was no surprise to them when I wanted to purchase them.</p><p>"My mum is always helping me pick out the cutest outfits when we're out shopping and also helps hold the babies in pose when needed.</p><p>"My dad says it's freaky how real they are and he can't believe the work which goes into them, but he still supports my hobby.</p><p>"Both of my nans adore them and love when I bring them round, as they jump at the chance of a baby cuddle.</p><p>"I've never been someone to have lots of friends, but the small circle I do have always support me and follow me on social media – they also ask for photos of them in their latest outfits."</p><p>The reborn community also gets a lot of hate for 'wasting' real baby products, but this isn't the case for [most] of us</p><span class=quote-credit>Raya</span><p>In her most popular video, detailing baby Brynn’s morning routine, she shows the doll "waking up", before feeding and clothing her, and taking the baby out in her pram.</p><p>Users flocked to the comments to share their reactions, with many believing the baby was real and others, who couldn't believe their eyes.</p><p>One person said: "Genuinely curious why'd do you do this?"</p><p>Someone else commented: "What is baby not real??!"</p><p>One user said: "I thought it was real."</p><p>Another fan commented: "WHERE CAN I GET ONE IM OBSSESSED."
