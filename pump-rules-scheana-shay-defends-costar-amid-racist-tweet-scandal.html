I don’t condone that whatsoever,” Shay told Us at Blumhouse’s Fantasy Island red carpet event in Los Angeles on Tuesday, February 11. “But I will say that Max, despite what you’ve seen on the show so far, he is — and I know I say this a lot as well — one of my best friends. But he really is a good person and he has a good heart. I know he is very apologetic for anything he said that was stupid in the past.”</p><p>The TomTom general manager, who <a href=#>briefly dated Shay</a> last year, apologized for his old tweets after they were brought back up and noted that his disrespectful comments were “wrong on every level.”</p><p>Boyens continued in his statement, “It is not a representation of who I am. I am shocked I ever tweeted that — and I am disgusted and embarrassed. I am truly sorry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Scheana-Shay-Says-Max-Boyens-Has-Good-Heart-After-Racist-Tweets-Get-Out-02.jpg><p>While Shay seemed to be showing support for her ex through his scandal, <a href=#>other Vanderpump Rules cast members</a> didn’t share the same amount of grace for Boyens’ past mistakes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“A lot of the cast is furious with Max and disgusted by his actions,” a source told Us exclusively shortly after the tweets resurfaced. “They have a zero-tolerance policy for what he said and a lot of them hope <a href=#><strong>Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a> fires Max for his ignorance and that Bravo doesn’t let him back on <a href=#>next season</a>.”</p><p>Costar <strong>Dayna Kathan</strong>, who expressed romantic interest in Boyens during the show’s <a href=#>eighth season</a>, admitted she felt “so embarrassed for pursuing him” after the scandalous posts came out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaprZ2lerPBy56qZquTnbKiusBmqqGZqWKxprLEp5usZZOkwLWt0WaYpqGUYr%2Bir8isq2asp5qytXnSnJinnJGhfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./philadelphia-eagles-photos-nfl-team-players-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Photos Of The NFL Teams Hottest Players Hollywood Life</span></a>
