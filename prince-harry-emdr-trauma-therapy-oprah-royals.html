I would just start sweating," he said.</p><p>During the docuseries, <a href=#>Prince Harry accused his family</a> of showing "total neglect" to his mental health woes and claimed that <a href=#>Prince Charles</a> made him "suffer".</p><p>&nbsp;"My father used to say to me when I was younger, he used to say to both&nbsp;<a href=#>William</a>&nbsp;and I, 'Well, it was like that for me so it’s going to be like that for you'," he told Oprah.</p><p>"That doesn’t make sense. Just because you suffered, that doesn’t mean your kids have to suffer. Actually quite the opposite.</p><p>"If you suffered, do everything you can to make sure that whatever negative experiences you had, you can make it right for your kids."</p><p>Meanwhile,<a href=#> the Queen is reportedly “deeply upset” </a>by Prince Harry’s “very personal” criticisms of the Royal Family.</p><p>The Royal Family has been rocked by&nbsp;Prince Harry&nbsp;unleashing a string of "truth bombs" that started with the interview he and his wife gave to&nbsp;Oprah&nbsp;in March.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">WHAT IS EMDR?</h3></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy</a>&nbsp;(BACP) states that EMDR therapy can help you process experiences that are having an impact on your mental health and wellbeing.</p><p>Dr Justin Havens&nbsp;said it involves using side to side eye movements combined with talk therapy in a specific and structured format.</p><p>It can help process negative images or emotions a person associates with a certain memory.</p><p>The therapy can help you see things from a different perspective and can also help you relieve symptoms.</p><p>It can help with conditions such as PTSD, anxiety, depression, addictions, behavioural difficulties, relationship issues and more serious mental illnesses such as psychosis and personality disorders.</p><p>Dr Havens said: "Many of these problems may actually be rooted in some kind of trauma, whether that’s someone being bullied, criticised or abused in some way, either during childhood or as an adult, and it isn’t always obvious that this is the case."</p><p>An unnamed source told the&nbsp;<a href=#>Mail on Sunday</a>: “Harry’s grandmother has taken this very personally and is deeply upset by what Harry has said, in particular, his comments about Charles’s parenting and suggesting his father knows no better because of how he was brought up.</p><p>“It has been a very upsetting time.”</p><p>But despite the attacks, Charles is said to want a reconciliation.</p><p>A friend told the paper: “I don’t think the Prince will cut his son off despite what Harry has said.</p><p>“Charles will want to engage, but it’s fair to say what Harry has said in both interviews with Oprah has been seen as very callous within the family. If Harry was to attack the Queen in a more personal way, Charles would close ranks with the Queen without a doubt and Harry would be out in the cold.”</p><p>The friend added: “Charles is such a gentleman and a dedicated father first and foremost. He’ll be feeling wretched. He wants to seek reconciliation. He is not vindictive at all.”</p><p>It comes during a turbulent time for the Royal Family with <a href=#>Prince Charles reportedly furious at the "lurid lies" from Panorama's interview</a> with Princess Diana that took 27 years to be finally publicly corrected.</p><p>The BBC has written to the&nbsp;Prince of Wales&nbsp;to apologise for&nbsp;<a href=#>Martin Bashir</a>’s “deceitful” tactics in securing the interview and agreed to never show it again.</p><p>Bashir’s underhand tactics included highly damaging and untrue claims that Charles was “in love” with William and Harry’s nanny&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiggy Legge-Bourk</a>e and that his valet was pushing to sell stories to newspapers.</p><p>A friend of the Prince of Wales said: “The narrative that came from that interview about Charles needs to be changed.</p><p>“He is privately furious that it has taken 27 years. The interview and allegations caused long-term damage to the future king and his household.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON PRINCE HARRY</h2></p><p>In a letter sent by the BBC’s current&nbsp;<a href=#>Director-General Tim Davie</a>&nbsp;to Prince Charles, the Corporation apologised for Bashir’s “lurid and untrue claims” about the prince, members of his staff and other members of the Royal Family.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>The letter said the BBC accepts that Bashir made claims “intending to play on the princess’s fears, in order to arouse her interest in him, and without concern for the impact on those he maligned”.</p><p>Charles is not going to react publicly, a friend said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NINTCHDBPICT000653337025-15.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqumspmcqHxygY9tb21wZmS9s7XNnJxmoJGnv7p5xKabq2Wkp662ucBmq6Gdopa9unnOqamaoF2nvLqty6xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-viall-jokes-about-eating-lunch-in-windmill-with-tyler-cameron.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Viall Jokes About Eating Lunch in Windmill With Tyler Cameron</span></a>
