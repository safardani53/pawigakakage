“‘absolutely awful” cream tiles and did it all himself, with the help of his partner, Courtney, 28.</p><p>And the results are astounding, with the 33-year-old’s humble project having racked up over 8,000 views and 66 likes online (@martindiy).</p><p>“Anyone could do this with some basic tools,” he told <a href=#>NeedToKnow.co.uk.</a> “I had seen a load of people on <a href=#>TikTok</a> using vinyl and paint to overhaul their kitchens and wanted to give it a try.</p><p>“It seemed a <a href=#>nice</a> cost-friendly way to make the worktops look fresh and offer a different look entirely.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more fabulous stories">read more fabulous stories</h2><p>“Courtney and I completed the renovations over around three weekends, so we would have a working kitchen in between on the weekdays.”</p><p>The dad scoured <a href=#>Facebook</a> Marketplace for bargain buys to spruce up the heart of his home.</p><p>He even managed to score some items for free, with generous people not expecting any dough in return for quality goods.</p><p>Martin said: “Some items we got for free from Facebook Marketplace.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>“They were getting new kitchens and were getting rid of materials such as the worktops, extractor unit, and oven.</p><p>“[After] some thorough cleaning and we were happy to have them installed, [the] worktop colour didn't matter with us wrapping it all.”</p><p>The biggest dent in the piggy bank was for a new hob, which accounted for a quarter of the budget at £159.</p><p>Clearance sales and discounted offers proved to be quite a success with B&Q coming out on top.</p><p>Martin said: “Most of the other items we got from B&Q.</p><p>“Some of this was on clearance, such as the grey metallic tile grout.</p><p>“The likes of cupboard door handles can be expensive and we found the brushed stainless ones cheap on <a href=#>Amazon</a>.”</p><p>Despite finding most of the DIY to be a piece of cake, Martin was left dumbfounded by the vinyl wrapping.</p><p>He said: “The vinyl wrapping is definitely a skill that takes some practice, getting it straight at the start is the key.</p><p>“The only setback was the lack of skills tiling.</p><p>“Took some time to figure out the best way to do it but was fairly straightforward once you get in the swing of it.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Breakdown of Cost</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>*If you click on a link in this
