She is listening to those who have come forward and has been reaching out to initiate open and honest conversations.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lea-Michele-Is-Reaching-Out-to-Initiate-Honest-Conversations-Amid-Scandal.jpg><p>Earlier this month, the 33-year-old actress came under fire for <a href=#>allegedly making the set of Glee “a living hell”</a> for former costar <strong>Samantha Marie Ware</strong>. After Michele showed her support for the Black Lives Matter movement on June 1, the 28-year-old What/If actress called her out for her past behavior.</p><p>“I BELIEVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT IF TOU [sic] HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD ‘S–T IN MY WIG!’ AMONGST OTHER TRAUMATIC MICROAGGRESSIONS THAT MADE ME QUESTION A CAREER IN HOLLYWOOD,” Ware tweeted.</p><p>Shortly after Ware’s allegations made headlines, more of Michele’s costars began to share their own experiences with the former Broadway star. Spring Awakening‘s <a href=#><strong>Gerard Canonico</strong></a> claimed the actress was “nothing but a nightmare” to her castmates and Broadway crew, while <a href=#>Glee alum <strong>Heather Morris</strong></a> alleged she was “unpleasant to work with.” <a href=#><strong>Elizabeth Aldrich</strong></a>, who was Michele’s understudy in Ragtime, said that she “used to cry every night from the mean and manipulative things” Michele did.</p><p>As more claims continued to emerge, HelloFresh ended their partnership with the Scream Queens alum. Michele eventually <a href=#>broke her silence on the scandal</a>, admitting that she “clearly acted in ways which hurt other people.”</p><p>“Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be <a href=#>perceived as insensitive</a> or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused,” she wrote via Instagram on June 3. “We all can grow and change and I have definitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings.”</p><p>Despite widespread criticism, some of Michele’s former colleagues came to her defense. <strong>Dean Geyer</strong>, who played Rachel Berry’s boyfriend during the fourth season of Glee, told the Daily Mail earlier this month that <a href=#>Michele was one of his “favorite costars”</a> and she’s “super fun to be around.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another source who previously worked with Michele later told Us that the Mayor alum <a href=#>was “completely self-obsessed,”</a> but “she did not discriminate” against any of her costars. “It didn’t matter if you were young or old, black or white — it’s just kind of her world,” the source added.</p><p>For more on the allegations against Michele, watch the video above and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalnZFiuqqvx56jnmWZqHqzscCcn6Kml2K8tsCMn6arZZiku6a%2F02aaqKammr%2B0rdOipqerXZa6qrCMrJqappSWuXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leela-gandhi.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Leela Gandhi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
