The boys then set fire to their Florida home in an effort to conceal their crime.</p><p>There has never been a clear motive established for the murder, but It is believed that the King brothers may have been under the influence of their neighbor, then 40-year-old convicted sex offender <strong>Ricky Chavis</strong>, who was convicted of being an accessory to the murder during a separate trial.<br></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Derek King’s statement</a> said Chavis “encouraged my brother Alex and I to run away” and skip school, let them stay up late and sleep late, and hid them when their father came over.</p><p>“He told us that Dad would kill us before he would let us live with Rick,” Derek said in the statement read by the judge.</p><p>Derek’s statement said that Chavis had encouraged the boys to lie by telling police that they had killed their father because he was abusive.</p><p>“That was not true,” Derek said. “My dad never abused me.”</p><p>Alex’s statement said Chavis had told him he loved him and that he was gay. Alex also agreed to testify against Chavis on a charge of being an accessory to the murder and another of lewd and lascivious behavior.</p><p>Alex King was released on Wednesday morning, April 9, 2008 at 9:45 a.m. after serving six years for his part in his father’s death. Derek King was released in March, 2009 after serving seven years for his part in his father’s death.</p><p><a title="larry king" href=# rel=noopener><strong>UPDATE: July 21, 2010 – LARRY KING INTERVIEW AND THEN AND NOW PHOTOS.</strong></a></p><p>Check out the Matt Lauer interview below:<br></p><p><br></p><p style="font-size:11px;font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;color:#999;margin-top:5px;background:0 0;text-align:center;width:425px">Visit msnbc.com for <a style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:400!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" href=# rel=noopener>Breaking News</a>, <a href=# style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:400!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" rel=noopener>World News</a>, and <a href=# style="text-decoration:none!important;border-bottom:1px dotted #999!important;font-weight:400!important;height:13px;color:#5799db!important" rel=noopener>News about the Economy</a></p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY6boK2slaOur7DBqKynnF9nfXGFjmlwaGhoZLiqusZmmaunpJ2ys7%2BMmqOesF2Wu6V5w56pnqNdoLavs4ytpp2ZqWLAqbvWZq2inJWkfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-gosselin-admits-to-physically-abusing-her-children-in-shock.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Gosselin Admits to Physically Abusing Her Children in Shocking Journal Entries!</span></a>
