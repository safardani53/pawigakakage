The program will include six singles and veterans from the last 90-Day Fiance spin-off. Debbie Johnson, 69, who appeared in season 2 of The Single Life series, is one of the singletons returning to the program. The new program will include individuals who have not been in a long-term relationship and have encountered the negative aspects of such relationships. However, in the new 90-Day Fiance series, they want to give themselves another shot to discover love.</p><p>According to the official summary of 90 Day Fiance: The Single Life,</p><p>“On the brand new season of THE SINGLE LIFE, fans will follow six motivated singles as they re-enter the world of romance after failing overseas romances.” These six individuals are taking another shot on love, overcoming relationship obstacles ranging from commitment-phobia to interfering matchmakers to ever-present ex-boyfriends.”</p><p>It also says:</p><p>“As they re-enter the dating scene, these individuals will be given a few curveballs.” Will their blooming relationships score home runs, or will they strike out once more?”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Debra-Johnson-1.jpg alt="Debra Johnson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Debbie Johnson has been unmarried since 2008, according to 90 Day Fiance: The Single Life.</h2><p>Debbie Johnson has been unmarried since 2008, when her spouse died. She previously went on the program to support her son Colt Johnson. Colt is currently living with his wife, Vanessa Guerra. Debbie adores Colt and refers to him as his “wonder baby.” Despite physicians’ predictions that she would never be able to conceive, she gave birth to him. Debbie had taught him at home for many years.</p><p>Furthermore, Colt addressed his relationship with his mother on the show:</p><p>“She was my instructor for many years and she means a lot to me.” My mother homeschooled me through middle and high school. There is undoubtedly a stigma of homeschooled children being strange or socially uncomfortable.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Debra-Johnson-2.jpg alt="Debra Johnson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Debbie was first featured on the program in season 6 of 90 Day Fiance: Happily Ever After? which aired from late 2018 to early 2019. The program then followed his relationship with Larissa Dos Santos Lima, whom he met on a dating service. The pair divorced in 2019 after marrying in 2018. Following that, Colt married Vanessa in 2021, which Debbie approved of.</p><p>Vanessa, on the other hand, has strained the mother-son connection. Debbie and Vanessa’s relationship was fantastic after Colt’s marriage, but she eventually began to feel smothered by Debbie. Debbie, Vanessa thought, was meddling heavily in their marriage. Vanessa was about to divorce, but the pair reconsidered and agreed to give it a go by moving in together.&nbsp;Viewers may follow Debbie’s new love adventure when 90 Day Fiance: The Single Life premieres on September 12 at 8 p.m. ET. Fans will be reminded of earlier twists while being astonished by fresh ones.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>90 Day: The Single Life</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Debra Johnson</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibnpqilnqru8enqqimXay2rbiMm5xmnpWWwba%2BxJ1kmqtdlnqku82tnKyskaPBbrXNZnBpZZSWxm7Ax55krKGenLmmecuinZ5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amina-mirzoevas-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Amina Mirzoevas Boyfriend: Who is Amina Mirzoeva Dating?</span></a>
