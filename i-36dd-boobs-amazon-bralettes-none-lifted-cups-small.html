It’s available in sizes XS to Large and retails between $38 and $43.</p><p>“Let’s start with the cups,” she said, adding: “The bottom of my bust is way down here,” as she pointed out that the cups were much smaller and higher than her natural breast shape.</p><p>She attempted pulling the top down, which left more of her chest exposed, but ultimately said that her breasts were still too big for the cups.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fashion</h2></p><p>“It’s pushing the girls down, which you don’t want in a bralette,” she added.</p><p>Next, Shelli was wearing a boxy and flimsy silver crystal crop top.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/52d36eef-ff0b-4182-8680-c5ebf0375719.jpg><p>Saying the bare minimum, she revealed: “As I was trying to get this one on, it broke,” before immediately changing out of it.</p><p>While the $47 <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Fstrend Crystal Rhinestones Crop Tank Top</a> didn’t work this time around, Shelli still recommended it in her Amazon storefront.</p><p>For her final try-on, she was equally disappointed and unimpressed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/0c9a0dc6-e090-4323-8162-983c140001f9-1.jpg><p>Shelli wore a fitted silver crystal bralette, which clearly didn’t lift up her chest as she had desired.</p><p>“Another one where the cup size is incredibly too small,” she said.</p><p>When she turned to the side, she showed that she was wearing a nude strapless bra underneath or else she would’ve flashed some side boob and “ooze out the sides.”</p><p>“You could wear this <a href=#>without a bra</a>, if the cups actually fit your bust,” Shelli said.</p><p>To solve this problem, she threw a satin black blazer over the bralette.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/12/1881992f-bad2-4377-b12b-1c65188c86cd.jpg><p>She also revealed that there was supposed to be a black band under the cups.</p><p>“But when your bust is large and you’ve got a belly, it just gets eaten right up,” she revealed.</p><p>From the look of the bralette and Shelli’s description, she was either wearing the $50 ELLACCI <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Rhinestone Diamond Push Bustier</a> or the $48 Atokiss <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Handmade Rhinestone Shining Diamond Push Up Bustier</a>.</p><p>Unhappy with the three <a href=#>Amazon bralettes</a>, Shelli said: “Such a bummer.
