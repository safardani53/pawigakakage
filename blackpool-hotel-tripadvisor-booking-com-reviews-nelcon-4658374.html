text <a href=#>after her Booking.com post</a>.</p><p>She complained of a "horrendous smell as soon as you walk in, grime in the shower and dirty towels", scoring the&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;3.8 out of 10.</p><p>Now it has emerged that she is far from the only person to slam the hotel's cleanliness, reported <a href=# rel=noopener>the MEN</a>.</p><p>In one TripAdvisor review titled 'Mi Casa, Poo Casa', Becky J from Birmingham wrote: "We went up the filthy stairs (photos) and entered our awful room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

longer.</p><p>"I pulled the bed cover back to discover crisps (I think) and loads of hair.</p><p>"The sheets were crumped [sic], I don't believe they had been changed since the last person.</p><p>"There was a giant orange stain on the duvet cover in the shape of a body."</p><p>In another one-star TripAdvisor <a href=# rel=noopener>review</a>, May2412 claimed the hotel was in an "awful condition".</p><p>"It may be cheap but anyone would still expect a normal living standard to be supplied," they wrote.</p><p>"This is totally sub standard and they should focus on bettering cleanliness."</p><p>The unfavourable reviews continue on <a href=# rel=noopener>Booking.com</a> where it has a rating of 6.8 out of 10 after 179 guests reviewed it.</p><p>One reviewer Martin said: "Good job it was one night or we (would have) gone home.</p><p>"The shed at home (is) cleaner."</p><p>Mrs Chance was having a getaway with her husband Michael to celebrate their second wedding anniversary in September.</p><p>A Nelcon&nbsp;Hotel&nbsp;spokesman responded publicly to Emily's Booking.com review, asking her: "Can I ask, just what did you expect for what you paid?"</p><p>They added that "most of what you describe I do not recognise as a matter of interest" and "I think possibly you were expecting a four-star&nbsp;hotel".</p><img

Emily's phone.</p><p>The message read (sic): "For someone who has never been away before you do not come across as nervous in fact you come across as a nasty piece of work who probably should be put on a diet as you must hate everything and everyone."</p><h3><a class=tealium-inter-para-link href=#>HOLIDAY FAILS <span>These are some of the hilariously honest TripAdvisor reviews by tourists who were not impressed</span></a></h3><p>He later said: "I don't have a problem with people reviewing us, but what she wrote was a pack of lies.</p><p>"The&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;is not dirty and doesn't smell.</p><p>"The review was disgusting and reduced a female member of staff to tears.</p><p>"This is a budget&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;but we are not dirty and don't deserve to be lied about."</p><img

about the text message, Emily said: 'I left an honest review about how bad Nelcon&nbsp;Hotel&nbsp;is only to have one of the staff make it their business to go into my account and personally text me an offensive text from their personal mobile number to mine telling me I needed to go on a diet.</p><p>"This should not be allowed, it was a little too personal and they had no right making personal digs to paying customers. It is an outrage.</p><p>"They need exposing and people need to be warned how bad this&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;really is.</p><p>"I would never recommend this to anyone it's not fit for a dog to be staying in."</p><p>Not all TripAdvisor reviews about the hotel were negative, as one wrote: "I don't know what the fuss is about with all the nasty reviews because for £10 I don't think it's all that bad.</p><p>"We was greeted by Ken and he was a lovely bloke he took over the hotel in April so he is renovating the place with new carpets and new gadgets but it does take time.</p><p>"Yes it's a bit dated but at the end of the day it's just a budget hotel not the Ritz."</p><p>Another review with the caption 'perfect break', added: "We had a lovely stay it was very clean and homely.</p><p>"I hope to visit again really soon and would recommend it to any one."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
