The show, which premiered on February 16, sees <a href=#>Joel McHale</a> make his comedic return to network television. Joel stars as Frank Shaw, a former cop that now serves as a senior animal control officer. The first run of the series wraps on May 4, and now fans are wondering if the Seattle-set comedy will return for Season 2.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Joel opened up about his hopes for the future of the show and revealed that he is trying to convince his former Community co-star star Ken Jeong to come on board. “I haven’t locked him in yet because this happened so fast. If we get a second season, Ken better do it,” Joel told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>. “He is busier than I am and I’m an OCD workaholic.”</p><p>During the interview, the actor also gushed over his time on the set of Animal Control, which was filled with a wide array of exotic animals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Fans of the series share Joel’s optimism about the future of Animal Control. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viewers</a> have taken to Twitter to demand a second run of the quirky comedy, so we decided to do some research. Here’s everything we know about the status of Animal Control Season 2.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The future of ‘Animal Control’ remains uncertain.</h2><p>Viewership for Animal Control compares favorably to other Fox shows. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Series Finale</a>, Season 1 of the Joel-led comedy averaged a 0.25 rating in the 18-49 demographic, with 1.3 million viewers. In comparison, viewership for the first inception of the series falls a bit below that of Fox’s powerhouse series, 9-1-1 and The Simpsons. Furthermore, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> suggests that Animal Control is “considered a lock for a Season 2 renewal.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And while fans of the show are undoubtedly hoping for an official renewal, the series recently faced backlash from PETA for its use of live animals on-set. In a statement released on February 17, PETA called Animal Control a “Sickening soup of animal exploitation,” per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>. The animal rights group went on to question whether the show's star was “living under a rock,” suggesting that the series could instead make use of CGI instead of animal actors.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The entire cast will likely return!</h2><p>Despite the backlash, the actors who star as the outlandish bunch of Seattle animal control officers are likely to return for a second season. Grace Palmer, who stars as Victoria Sands in the Fox comedy, took to social media to rejoice over her time on-set and shared a loving message to her co-stars.</p><p>“This job couldn’t have been more joyous,” she wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. “All the people (and animals) involved were fricken RAD.” The post includes a slideshow filled with pictures and videos of the cast creating TikToks, taking selfies, and enjoying time with the animal actors.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Joining Joel and Grace in the chaotic enforcement squad are Michael Rowland, Ravi Patel, and <a href=#>Vella Lovell</a>. Michael plays Fred "Shred" Taylor, a novice animal control officer and Frank’s seemingly helpless partner. Ravi Patel takes on the role of Amit Patel, a family man who had a painful run-in with a kangaroo in Season 1. While Vella plays precinct director Emily Price, the leader of the crew of misfit officers.</p><p>New episodes of Animal Control air Thursdays at 9 p.m EST on Fox.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflruqucClZJynnqm%2FsLiMrJyaq5%2BjenM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-charlie-blackmon-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Charlie Blackmon Dating Now</span></a>
