Shaheed Fatima QC was monstered in open court by Mr Justice Swift after handing an embargoed legal document to a PR strategist.
The court heard she emailed the papers, strictly for lawyers’ eyes only, to “reputation specialist” Tim Robinson - a partner at privacy-loving law firm Schillings.
To make matters worse, Ms Fatima only admitted to the breach on Wednesday - nearly a week after she leaked the draft judgment - and repeatedly failed to apologise."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
