<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tottenham</a> missed out on Champions League qualification by a point.</p><p>Daniel Levy was bullish that he could keep his star asset, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Madrid</a> turned on their charm offensive and it soon became just a matter of when, not if.</p><p>So Spurs got busy, signing seven new players for more than £100million - as the line went, they'd 'sold Elvis, and signed The Beatles'.</p><p>But while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bale</a> was off winning Champions League titles with Madrid, Spurs' new signings were producing contrasting performances.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more tottenham news">read more tottenham news</h2><p>So let's take a look at what became of the 'Magnificent Seven'.</p><h2>ROBERTO SOLDADO - £26m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ff4ce676-b8f7-4de0-8ff3-553ec7b014d0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000621633925.jpg><p>Spaniard Soldado was probably the most exciting of the acquisitions, when he arrived from Valencia for £26m, fresh from wowing at the Confederations Cup and banging in 24 goals in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LaLiga</a>.</p><p>Despite no lack of trying, his time at White Hart Lane was a disaster, however, as he only managed seven goals in 52 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Premier League</a> appearances - with five of them coming from the penalty spot.</p><p>Levy did manage to squeeze £10m out of Villarreal for his services in 2015, and he has since played for Fenerbahce and Granada.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Now 37, he plays for Spanish second division side Levante - where he has 10 goals in 47 games across two seasons.</p><h2>PAULINHO - £17m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000311318732.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000618636880.jpg><p>Another that arrived off the back of a stellar Confederations Cup, Spurs fans thought they were getting 'the Brazilian <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Lampard</a>' when Paulinho arrived in N17.</p><p>Initial performances were steady, with a late back-heeled winner at Cardiff prompting pandemonium among the travelling supporters.</p><p>Things went downhill very quickly, however, with Paulinho being red carded in Andre Villas-Boas' final game in charge, before becoming a nervous wreck barely capable of completing a five-yard pass by the end.</p><p>He was offered a career lifeline by Chinese Super League giants Guangzhou Evergrande, where he became a big star - via a very strange, if not totally unsuccessful year at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barcelona</a>.</p><p>Paulinho, 34, linked <a href=#>up with Saudi side Al-Ahli</a> but signed a deal with Corinthians in 2022.</p><h2>VLAD CHIRICHES - £8m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/85b05765-8c30-4815-977c-f6ea2ee98d1e.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000621609549.jpg><p>Fans were excited at Chiriches' arrival, as they thought they'd unearthed a hidden gem from Steaua Bucharest, with a penchant for playing the ball out from the back.</p><p>And while he was very laid back, it often proved to be to the team's detriment, as his casual style tended to gift opponents easy goals, while leaving fans' hearts in their mouths.</p><p>Like Soldado and Paulinho, Chiriches lasted two seasons at the Lane, before being shipped off to Napoli.</p><p>The Romanian managed just 48 appearances across four seasons at San Paulo, before joining Sassuolo on loan two years ago - before making it permanent for just shy of £10m.</p><p>Last summer, he was snapped up by Cremonese - and at 33 still plays in Serie A.</p><h2>NACER CHADLI - £7m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3574fbca-dc16-4872-bde5-78d48067ce52.jpg><p>One of the more successful acquisitions of that summer, Chadli became a popular figure at Spurs despite an underwhelming start.</p><p>The Belgian joined from FC Twente, having scored against Tottenham home and away in the 2010-11 Champions League campaign.</p><p>But it was not until his second season that he really began to shine, scoring 13 goals as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mauricio Pochettino</a> began to transform the club's fortunes.</p><p>He left for West Brom in 2017, eventually joining Istanbul Basaksehir in 2020, via stints at Monaco and Anderlecht.</p><p>This season, the Turkish team loaned the now 33-year-old to Belgium side KVC Westerlo, who he has scored five goals in 23 games for.</p><h2>ETIENNE CAPOUE - £9m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/NINTCHDBPICT000026446235.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/a553da3b-7dd8-40b6-8fb9-930e695066b9.jpg><p>Neither wildly awful nor outstandingly memorable, Capoue is possibly the most forgettable player of the seven.</p><p>With Sandro having regressed due to knee injuries, Capoue initially seemed to be the perfect foil for Mousa Dembele in his place.</p><p>But the Frenchman fell out of favour despite steady performances, although was hung out to dry following a few awful displays as a makeshift centre-back.</p><p>He lasted one season beyond Pochettino's arrival in 2014, before joining Watford.</p><p>Capoue made 11 outings in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Championship</a> in the first half of the 2020-21 season, before signing for Villarreal in the January transfer window.</p><p>And his impact was immediate as he helped the Spanish side beat Manchester United in the Europa League final - the club's first major trophy in their history.</p><p>While he was also crucial in their Champions League run last season to the semi-final.</p><h2>CHRISTIAN ERIKSEN - £11m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/872788e8-0cca-403b-aab8-7e9b83e9156d.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/christian-eriksen-manchester-united-carabao-787667333.jpg><p>Without doubt the most successful acquisition of that summer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Christian Eriksen</a> was an outstanding, indispensable member of the squad for six years, before eventually <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">departing for Inter Milan</a> in January 2020.</p><p>A bargain at £11m, the Dane, 31, papered over cracks during Tim Sherwood's tenure, pulling out a brilliant goal or moment of genius time and time again to dig the team out of trouble.</p><p>He then became vital to Pochettino's side, so much so that they struggled to adapt whenever he was absent.</p><p>Eriksen admitted his desire to 'try something new' after losing the 2019 Champions League final and joined Inter six months later.</p><p>The playmaker helped Inter win the Serie A title last season, but <a href=#>his playing career hung in the balance after he suffered a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020</a>.</p><p>However, he returned to the Premier League last season on a short term deal with Brentford.</p><p>His excellent performances earned Eriksen a move to Man Utd, where he has enjoyed a stellar season this campaign, although injury reduced his appearances to 41 games.</p><h2>ERIK LAMELA - £30m</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/141cb298-6789-4c9b-ab3f-9f29e3f48ed6.jpg><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="BETTING SPECIAL - BEST SPORTS BETTING APPS IN THE UK (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">BETTING SPECIAL - BEST SPORTS BETTING APPS IN THE UK</a></strong></p><p>Erik Lamela became the last of the 'Magnificent Seven' to depart North London for Spain.</p><p>Argentine Lamela, 31, actually had a bizarre start at Spurs, starting just three league matches in his first season before disappearing back to his homeland following a back injury early on in Tim Sherwood's tenure.</p><p>He returned following his compatriot Pochettino's arrival, wrestling for a starting berth before sustaining a troublesome hip injury in October 2016 that would keep him out for 13 months.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Lamela again recovered and returned to action - chipping in with 255 appearances <a href=#>before joining Sevilla in a swap deal with Bryan Gil heading in the opposite direction</a>.</p><p>His most memorable moment will be his 'rabona' strike in the 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, with <a href=#>his strike winning the Premier League Goal of the Season award</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2aAc4SRb2dxZ6SkwbWxzaGYpmWkp66vv8Weqaxll5a%2FpsDHZpmapJViurC6xLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hasta-los-dientes-meaning-camila-cabello.html><span>←</span><span>What Does &amp;quot;Hasta Los Dientes&amp;quot; by Camila Cabello Mean?</span></a>
