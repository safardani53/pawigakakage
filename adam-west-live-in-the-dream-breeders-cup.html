He has been busy mapping out his route to Santa Anita with shock Nunthorpe winner Live In The Dream.
And he has decided to skip the Prix de l'Abbaye on Arc day and instead have an early crack at the Americans in the Woodford Stakes at Keeneland on October 7.
The four-year-old, who showed blistering speed when winning York’s big Group 1 sprint last month, will fly out to Kentucky next Thursday."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
