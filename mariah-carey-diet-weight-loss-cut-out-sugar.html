The 48-year-old songbird wore a skin right black mini-dress for an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on June 6 and looked thinner than she has in ages. That’s because she’s finally eliminated sugar from her diet.&nbsp;“<span class=il>Mariah</span>&nbsp;has been working with a personal trainer and a nutritionist to shed&nbsp; pounds and get her body back to amazing shape.&nbsp;<span class=il>Mariah</span>&nbsp;loves smoked salmon and capers, so she eats a lot of that lean protein, but the secret to her success has been the one thing she cut out almost completely, and that is processed sugar,” a source close to the “Hero” singer tells <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY.</p>“She has cut out chocolate and other sweets and when she has cravings, she eats a little piece of fruit, like some blueberries or mangos. She is also working out regularly and eating clean, whole foods with a focus on vegetables. She has also cut out carbs and bread. As a result, she has lost a ton of weight and is looking and feeling great!,” our insider continues. The singer&nbsp;reportedly underwent a gastric sleeve operation in Nov. 2017, and the new diet has helped her <a href=#>drop an estimated 50 pounds</a>.<p>“Her one guilty pleasure, that she will never stop enjoying, is her wine. She likes to sip on a glass of red or white at the end of a long day and that’s something that&nbsp;<span class=il>Mariah</span>&nbsp;will probably never change,” our source adds. Mariah revealed to Jimmy that she doesn’t celebrate birthdays or anniversaries to which he was aghast, asking if she ever had cake to mark the occasions. She revealed that she would only eat “a morsel” of the tempting dessert, showing what kind of amazing self-restraint she has when it comes to her diet. Mimi will be returning to a Vegas residency on July 5 at Caesar’s Palace so no doubt she’s going to be flaunting her new figure in plenty of sexy costumes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH13e49wZqaZop6uqXnCmqmesV2ZtqbAjLCcop%2BYqXqtu9KsZJytpGK8tsCMrKygmaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leonard-marshall.html><span>←</span><span>Leonard Marshall</span></a>
