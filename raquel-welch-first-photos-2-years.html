The star’s last public interview was in 2018, when she spoke to&nbsp;The Sunday Post&nbsp; about her life and career. In her late 70s at the time, she explained that she still enjoyed the attention she received as a movie star. “It is nice to be noticed… I think it is much better than not being noticed!” she told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Post</a>. “My whole career has been about being noticed, just like any other actor or actress, so I am grateful that people are still interested.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>One of Raquel’s breakout roles in the 1960s was the prehistoric adventure film&nbsp;One Millions Years B.C.&nbsp;where photos of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>actress in a fur bikini</a> made her into an international sensation! The image of her in the film became a popular poster. She explained that she still regularly gets requests for her to sign the iconic photo. “Almost every day I get copies of the photo sent to me for an autograph. I must have looked at that photo one million times,” she told&nbsp;The Post.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=content-paragraph-5>Even though the star has remained out of the public eye for over two years, Raquel seemed open to further acting roles in the 2018 interview. “I am very selective about what work I accept but I am nowhere near calling an end to it all. As long as people are still interested in me, then I’ll carry on working,” she said and joked that she may break out her iconic bikini if&nbsp;Two Million Years B.C.&nbsp;gets written.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FsZquZoaqyrXnWnqOcoF2btrO%2F02anoaekpMBufoyynJqqo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kris-jenner-fan-horrified-caved-nostril-unedited-photos-nyc.html><span>←</span><span>Kris Jenner fans horrified at her 'caved-in nostril' as they zoom in on shocking unedited photos at</span></a>
