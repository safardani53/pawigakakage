People are frustrated, people are angry, they want to know how is this happening, and they want answers — and they turn to me and they say, 'Why don’t you be a man and stand up and name names and stop hiding and being a coward?'".</p><p>"I have to deal with that, which is not pleasant, especially given the fact that I would love to name names. "I’d love to be the first to do it. But unfortunately California conveniently enough has a statute of limitations that prevents that from happening."</p><p>The extent of the abuse was laid bare in a 2014 documentary that claimed the boys were raped at gunpoint and took cocaine at Hollywood parties.</p><p>Feldman<a href=#> claimed to reveal the names of those</a>&nbsp;within the Hollywood industry who he claims raped and abused the pair when they were child stars.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">synopsis for the documentary</a> stated Feldman and his director Brian Herzlinger "fully lift back the velvet curtains of Hollywood and expose another world that the average person cannot begin to imagine.</p><p>"Featuring interviews with co stars Keith Coogan, Jamison Newlander, Susie Feldman, and the late Kristoff St John in his final words, speaking openly about the topic of child abuse in Hollywood!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003612261791-e1583857492400.jpg><h2>What are the allegations of rape against Charlie Sheen?</h2><p>Charlie Sheen was accused of raping Corey Haim in 1986 -&nbsp;Sheen has categorically denied these allegations.</p><p>Actor Dominick Brascia and friend of Haim – who died in 2010 as a result of pneumonia – says the former child star confided in him about the encounter with Charlie Sheen.</p><p>Brascia added that Haim told him he later had consensual sex with the Wall Street star while in his mid-to-late 20s.</p><p>Haim’s close pal Corey Feldman – who has alleged that he and his friend were abused by a Hollywood paedophile ring – also alluded to the abuse in his book Coreyography: A Memoir.</p><h2>What has Charlie Sheen said about the allegations?</h2><p>A spokesman for the actor told the Sun:&nbsp;"He categorically denies these allegations."</p><p>Haim's mum, Judy, spoke out after the claims emerged and said her son was abused by a man on the set of the film Lucas, but it was not Sheen.</p><p>She told Dr Oz: "I would have known if anything was wrong. My kid hid nothing, he was like transparent."</p><p>And Feldman made the claims again in his new documentary, (My) Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys, which was released in March 2020.</p><p>However, Charlie Sheen once again denied all claims in a statement which read: "These sick, twisted and outlandish allegations never occurred.
