That was three years ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506489.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506478.jpg><p>Now the Macari Centre on Hanley’s Regent Road next door to the City Central Mosque stands as a monument to the humanity of the Celtic and Manchester United legend.</p><p>When SunSport paid a visit to Macari, who made 401 appearances and scored 97 goals for the Red Devils, said: “The idea that I might be some sort of special person because I do this...it’s just not what I am or see.</p><p>“All I am interested in is making this place work and if it doesn’t work all these people here, they are back on the street.</p><p>“It’s not just football that is a results business — as I’ve found out, as Jose Mourinho has just found out. Establishments like this one are the same. But I’m glad to say, thanks to the incredible generosity of so many, things are going well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506490.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506496.jpg><p>“We’ve got about 20 turkeys stacked away back there in a fridge for Christmas dinner — I think they’re breeding!</p><p>“If we are short of anything — food, clothing, bedding, anything, I just let it be known and local people, businesses are there for us.</p><p>“And you should see Sunday nights in here. Every week at about 8pm a local supermarket sends a taxi full of fancy cakes made by Patisserie Valerie not sold that day. The place erupts — I swear, they make more noise than Old Trafford.”</p><p>A resident — a Liverpool supporter — interrupts to remind Macari about United’s 3-1 defeat at Anfield a few days earlier.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>It’s match week 18 of the Premier League as Chelsea greet Leicester City and Cardiff welcomes Manchester United</span><p>But the Liverpool fan gets a reminder himself, that it has been a lot longer than a few days&nbsp; — 28 years — since the Anfield club have&nbsp; won the league title.</p><p>It is an example of the constant banter, mostly about football, that goes on within the building that houses two dorms for men and one for women.</p><p>Macari added: “I knew nothing at all about the homeless until I went out that night and saw it with my own eyes.</p><p>“When I decided to do something about it I knew nothing about setting up anything like this place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506524.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506534.jpg><p>“What I have learned is this — that guy I was just having a laugh with, all of these people, they are human beings who should be treated as such.</p><p>“They have their problems — drink, drugs, family violence, crime, emotional difficulties.</p><p>“You name it, we see it all here but there for the grace of God go so many. So what I have learned is that if you treat them with dignity and respect, they respond.</p><p>“Some establishments are run on very different lines to this one —&nbsp; regimented, full of rules and disciplines that a lot of people we see here struggle to deal with.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN SPORT</h2></p><p>“What I believe is that the more you talk to them, the more you communicate, the more they will tell you what they are going through, how better you can help them.</p><p>“If I don’t make them trust me and talk to me, how am I supposed to know if their problem, say, is being on the Monkey Dust or the Mamba? Aye, I know about terrible drugs like them now, too.”</p><p>There is money to be made from establishments like Macari’s. But Macari, who made Stoke his home after managing the Potters twice — the second spell between 1994 and 1997&nbsp;— does not take a penny.</p><p>Every bit of housing benefit the local council pay to the shelter, that currently contains 34 men and women, goes back into the project.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506612.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000457506523.jpg><p>On New Year’s Eve Macari will be taking all of them, and most of the 20 staff who help him run the place, to a local restaurant to celebrate.</p><p>As he often does to help make ends meet at his centre, he will be picking up the bill. But he does much more than that claims the former mayor of Stoke Anthony Munday.</p><p>He said: “Lou doesn’t just pick people up out of the gutter. He saves lives. There are people in this place who would be long dead without him.”</p><p>Munday, along with another ex– mayor in Terry Follows and former leader of Stoke council Dave Conway, helped Macari find the building that is now home to 27 men and seven women.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Liverpool are predicted to get record Premier League points tally this season… but Man City may still finish top</span><p>They continue to use their influence to support him. But while they sing his praises, Macari merely goes about the business of making sure his residents are cared for.</p><p>Macari, an FA Cup winner with United who beat arch-rivals Liverpool 2-1 in 1977, added: “What I know best of all is that there are so many&nbsp; people out there who need help like this.</p><p>“We take as many in as we can and they are free to remain here as long as they want or need to get themselves back on their feet. I wouldn’t have it any way.</p><p>“Once you realise how big the problem of homelessness is, how desperate so many are just to have a roof over their heads ...why wouldn’t you do everything to help them?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX219dXyUcW5opZGjerbAw2ajqK1doq6krdGiZKGnnZq5pr%2FSZqqhnZypsrN50q2mpJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-camp-skylar-astin-married-wedding-details.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Camp &amp;amp; Skylar Astin Married Wedding Details For Pitch Perfect Co-Stars Hollywood</span></a>
