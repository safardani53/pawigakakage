After posting a few updates on <a href=#>Snapchat</a> in the early afternoon hours, the girls were not seen or heard from again.</p><p>They were reported missing two hours after they didn't show up for their ride home, and their bodies were found the following day about half a mile away from the bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In the more than three years since the girls' tragic murders, very little evidence has been released about the case — including the cause of death. Investigators have explained that the details of the crime scene indicate a signature, which can help them identify the killer.</p><p>With less than 3,000 residents, Delphi is a town where everyone knows one another, and the murders have greatly affected many locals.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Amazingly, Libby German took a video of a man walking behind her and Abby Williams on the bridge, who is believed to be the killer. He can be heard saying, "Guys, down the hill," in the short video and investigators created two composite sketches based on this evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Text messages have been circulating online regarding the case, as has speculation about some of the evidence that is being kept under wraps.&nbsp;</p><p>Continue reading to find out what the alleged Delphi Murders <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked text messages</a> are all about.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What are those alleged Delphi Murders leaked text messages about?</h2><p>In September of 2020, messages began circulating online that were allegedly between the man who found the girls' bodies and his friend. The YouTube channel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zav Girl</a> broke down the text messages in a video entitled "Text Messages from the Guy that found Abby and Libby? What do you all think?" which has been viewed more than 18,000 times.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The friend texted a man named David, who claims to have found the bodies, because there were alleged crime scene photos leaked online. David shot that down, and he then explained how what he saw differed from these images.</p><p>"No, that's not her nor Libby," he wrote in his text response.&nbsp;</p><p>He later discussed the placement of Abby Williams' body at the crime scene, and he claimed that the victims were not sexually assaulted (none of this information has been publicly released yet). He detailed other information about the crime scene, and the differences in the girls' apparent injuries.</p><p>It is important to note that the validity of the text messages has not and cannot be corroborated at this time. The exact content of the messages can be viewed in the video below.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The video also broke down the cause of death rumors.</h2><p>The authorities have been purposeful in not disclosing much information about the Delphi Murders. The manner of death has never been revealed.</p><p>David, the person involved in the leaked text messages, claimed that the girls died from stabbing. He also noted that it appeared to him as if Libby German may have been personally attacked based on the extent of her injuries.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, the investigators have made it clear over the years that they are not yet ready to release further information about what happened to the teens. All of the speculation about their final moments is unconfirmed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are there any updates in the case?</h2><p>In the years since Libby German and Abby Williams were murdered, there have been no arrests. The FBI has released a description for the suspect, which is that he is a white male between 5'6" and 5'8" tall. On the day of the murders, he was wearing a blue jacket and jeans.</p><p>An updated sketch for the suspect was released in April of 2019, and no further information about his appearance has been publicly shared.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The investigators do believe that the suspect either lives or works in Delphi, Ind. and that he was likely familiar with the Monon High Bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from the sketches released, authorities have indicated that the killer left behind physical evidence. They have also suggested that the crime scene was odd in nature.&nbsp;</p><p>The case is still being actively investigated. Though there was no press conference held on the third anniversary of the murders in February of 2020, investigators said that the case was not cold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbKtvMeiZKatopmys7%2BMpZyao5WZerWx161kpp2jqK6osdI%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-sex-toys-for-beginners.html><span>←</span><span>19 Best Sex Toys for Beginners 2023 UK</span></a>
