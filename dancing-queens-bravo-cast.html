Source: Instagram/@bravotvIn Bravo's docuseries Dancing Queens, six ballroom dancing divas are spotlighted as they compete across the country. The show highlights Pro-Am dancing, where amateur dancers pair with professional dancers. However, in these events, only the amateur dancer is judged, increasing the pressure. Not to mention, some women spend six figures on costumes, training, and more."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Not to mention, some women spend six figures on costumes, training, and more.</p><p style=text-align:start>Let's get to know the cast of Dancing Queens.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sabrina Strasser from Toronto, Canada.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@sabrinaofficialdq</a></figure><p>When Sabrina's not busy being a stay-at-home mom, she's in an on-again, off-again professional relationship with her dance partner, Stanislav Kochergin. Sabrina's competitive streak sometimes hinders her personal life, especially when <a href=#>her husband</a> and kids worry that her drive to win takes away from her time at home.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Pooja Mehta from Scottsdale, Arizona.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@poojahimovich</a></figure><p>As a makeup artist and beauty guru, Pooja is a self-described "rebel" in her family of doctors. She and her husband are raising two children in a mix of Jewish and Hindu traditions. However, dancing is also a family tradition — Pooja, her mother, and her sister all dance! The only problem is that their current dance party is also Colette's ex-pro partner, Kristijan Burazer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Leonie Biggs from Haworth, New Jersey.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Bravo</a></figure><p>Leonie wants to have it all. Not only is she a mom and a dancer, but she has a demanding job in finance. This dance season, she also has a new professional partner, Koysta Samarskyi. Learning curves are typical for new relationships, even strictly ballroom ones, but Leonie is determined to do whatever it takes to be a champion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gaëlle Benchetrit from New York, New York.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gaelle_pereira-benchetrit</a></figure><p>Gaëlle was at the top of the competition, but a pregnancy stalled her dancing career before it took off. Now post-baby and back in the game, Gaëlle is the envy of the ballroom for her professional partner, Nino Langella, who also happens to be one of the top professional dancers in the world.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Donie Burch from New York, New York.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@donycie</a></figure><p>Donie has been passionate about dance since college, where she studied dance performance. Donie and her partner aim to be number one on the dance floor, but she also feels that not looking like a "stereotypical" dancer has held her back. Although she's currently single, Donie doesn't have a lot of room in her life for romance when her true love is ballroom dancing!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Colette Marotto from Scottsdale, Arizona.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@colettio2</a></figure><p>Colette sees dancing as a way to center herself in a busy life as a business owner and mom to <a href=# style=text-align:start>a son with special needs</a>. After her original dance partner left her to compete with Pooja, she found a new partner in Oleksiy "Alex" Pigotskyy. Starting from scratch isn't easy, but Colette's eyes are on the prize. As they say, "All's fair in war and ballroom!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Don't forget to check out the 'Dancing Queens' cast Instagrams for updates on the show.</h2><ul><li>Sabrina is on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@sabrinaofficialdq</a>.</li><li>See Pooja on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@poojahimovich</a>.</li><li>Leonie's handle is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@leonie.biggs</a>.</li><li>Don't miss out on Gaëlle's Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@gaelle_pereira_benchetrit</a>.</li><li>Check out Donie's Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@donycie</a>.</li><li>Find Colette on Instagram <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@colettio2</a>.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfma6vr8innmappZqyr7%2BMm6marp9isKK%2F0w%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ashton-kutcher-demi-moore-separated-cheating-sara-leal-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>Shocking Photos of Ashton Kutcher Partying With Blondes on Night He Allegedly Cheated!
