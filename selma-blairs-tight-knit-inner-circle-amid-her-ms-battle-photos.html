As <a href=#><strong>Selma Blair</strong></a> navigates <a href=#>her multiple sclerosis diagnosis</a>, the actress has<a href=#> a close group of pals in her corner</a>.</p><p class=p1>“Selma is one of my oldest best friends. …&nbsp;&nbsp;[She] is one of the strongest, bravest women that I know and if anybody can get through this, it’s her,” <a href=#><strong>Jaime King</strong></a> <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2018</a>. “I will be by her side, I will go to every appointment, I will do whatever she needs.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Legally Blonde</a>&nbsp;</i>actress previously announced in October 2018 that <a href=#>she had been diagnosed with MS</a> — and the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Hart of Dixie</a>&nbsp;</i>alum has been “really proud” of her friend’s candor about her journey “from the very beginning.”</p><p class=p1>King added at the time: “We’ve been through a lot with each other and I’m eternally grateful for her. I will do whatever it takes as her best friend to make sure that anything that I can do to support that I will be there.”</p><p class=p1>As the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Cruel Intentions</a>&nbsp;</i>star continued managing her health struggles, she <a href=#>decided to sign up for&nbsp;<i>Dancing With the Stars&nbsp;</i>season 31</a>. Despite Blair and pro partner<a href=#><strong> Sasha Farber</strong></a> proclaiming <a href=#>their team name was the “underdogs,”</a> she had several famous faces hoping for her success.</p><p class=p1>“My dear friend @selmablair is going to be on #DWTS Monday at 8ET/5PT on #DisneyPlus!” <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> captioned a September 2022 Instagram Story <a href=#>hours before the competition’s premiere episode</a>. “So proud of you! I can’t wait to cheer her on.”</p><p class=p1>During her debut dance, Blair and the Australia native<a href=#> impressed both the&nbsp;<i>DWTS</i>&nbsp;judges and the audience</a> with their emotional Viennese Waltz to “The Time of My Life” by<a href=#><strong> David Cook</strong></a>. The performance — which earned a score of 28 out of 40 from the judging panel — also saw the Michigan native leave her cane behind before getting into her first dance position with Farber.</p><p class=p1>“[My face] was streaming with tears. It’s just something that is so indescribable,” fellow&nbsp;<i>DWTS&nbsp;</i>pro <a href=#><strong>Emma Slater</strong></a> —<a href=#> who was previously married to Farber</a> — <a href=#>told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>and other reporters after the first episode.</a> “To look at her and to say she’s an inspiration is an understatement. She is just magical to me.”</p><p class=p1>The England native added: “Look, she’s actually living out her fear. And I know that took a lot of courage.&nbsp;I can’t even imagine what a true inspiration she is&nbsp;to a lot of people. … I feel blessed that she’s on the show.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Several of Blair’s famous friends gushed over her emotional dance via social media, including the likes of <a href=#><strong>Amy Purdy</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Constance Zimmer</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></a>. The<a href=#>&nbsp;<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer&nbsp;</i></a>alum, for her part, even shared Disney+’s voting instructions via her Instagram page to encourage followers to vote for Blair and Farber.</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to meet Blair’s inner circle:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKa4zJpkm6SRnr%2B0edOinqGsXaC7qsCMoqWnnaJisKq%2BwqWcZpmdnrFutMSrZKarXZeutcDLnmSpoJ%2BpvLR7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./scheana-marie-and-robert-valletta-engaged.html><span>←</span><span>Scheana Marie &amp;amp; Robert Valletta: Engaged?!</span></a>
