On March 2, she told People:</p><p>“To be honest, there’s a lot of fear and melancholy about coming on the show because, in a lot of ways, it’s like finally accepting that life has gone on.” He’s not coming back, and in a strange sense, when someone takes a step back, I can be in that bubble and defend it.”</p><p>On March 3, 2013, 13 months after her husband’s death, Thomas returned to the set of the NBC morning program. She told Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager that she felt fortunate to live there. She also launched a new initiative, “Dear Bobbie,” in which she would take letters from fans about their difficulties.</p><p>Before returning to Today, she wrote an article on the show’s website expressing gratitude for the opportunity to begin a new chapter in her life. She penned:</p><p>“I simply want to boomerang back with all my heart.” I’ve always felt the need to broaden my horizons as a girlfriend. I’ve referred to it as a ‘professional girlfriend,’ whether it was discussing the efficacy of lipstick or assisting with anything else in the lifestyle realm.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bobbie-Thomas-2.jpg alt="Bobbie Thomas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The essay goes on to say:</p><p>“What motivates me is knowing that I’m not alone.” And I believe the outpouring of love that I was fortunate to get and thankful for as a result of this platform has only pushed me to find meaning in my agony.”</p><h2>Bobbie Thomas’s spouse’s death</h2><p>Michael Marion, Bobbie Thomas’ husband, died of an ischemic stroke in April 2019 at 40. His wife had earlier given an update on her husband’s condition, saying:</p><p>“It’s rather fantastic. If you had told me a year ago what I would be dealing with in a year, it would have been too much to bear. I believe that concentrating on what was in front of us day by day has been fantastic since we now feel so lucky.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Bobbie-Thomas-3.jpg alt="Bobbie Thomas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She said, “People celebrate their achievements, and it’s difficult to appreciate minor things when they’re looking forward.” She remarked that she would never want the same thing to happen to anybody else, but there have been so many presents that they have had to reprioritize. It is an unbreakable relationship they have. Marion was wheeled out of the hospital following his stroke. At the time, Bobbie said that he had advanced to walking with help.</p><p>Michael died on December 1, 2020, when he was 42. His obituary paid respect to him as well, announcing his demise. Thomas and Marion married on May 31, 2013, at Kathie-Lee Gifford’s house in Connecticut. Miles Thomas Marion, the 47-year-first old’s child, was born in 2015. Bobbie Thomas is best known as the Style Editor for NBC’s Today Show. She is a beauty and fashion expert who has been on several TV series such as Fashion Police, The View, and The Wendy Williams Show.</p><p></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZqJqSnrJuwMeopJqrXaeytcHRp5ydZaSkerW0xGalm5tdoryzusinnmarmKTEbq2Mspyaql2Ws7Wx0WakopuYlrKtecyaqaKnnqh6pbHArZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-joe-budden-zodiac-sign.html><span>←</span><span>What is Joe Budden's zodiac sign?</span></a>
