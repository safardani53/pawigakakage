Sammy responded.</p><p>After returning home she realized she still wanted to tone down the pink.</p><p>Sammy wiped most of it off before remembering how the girl in the video had mentioned that it was a lip stain.</p><p>"I feel like it's the perfect natural pink," she explained.</p><p>And she was especially obsessed with the lip stain's long-lasting properties.</p><p>"This is so perfect for going to dinner, for making out. Now my lips are just going to look like this for the rest of the day. It's so worth $1.25 and it's the perfect color for my lips."</p><p>For those who have trouble snagging the balm at their local Dollar Tree, the buy sells for around $6 to $10 on various online shopping sites.</p><p>And there were plenty of satisfied lip-stained customers.</p><p>"I love this lip balm. The color is immediate and long-lasting and looks great," said this pleased reviewer.</p><p>This shopper had found a stockpile of the stain.</p><p>"$1.25 at Dollar Tree - I have five tubes," she said.</p><p>"It’s so pretty on you!" another remarked.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"I feel like lipsticks/lip balms like this one have a comeback every five to ten years," explained this trend spotter.</p><p>Yet another follower had her own tip for the product: "Use it as a blush!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/a6d66e45-c81d-46c6-bf3e-7c4d9417b5dc.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/434c9dfb-eb8e-4f81-aba5-85f394491d2d.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/dollar-tree-lip-buy-perfect-869442423.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/5af284d3-9471-4170-9cee-ec5a2031a4e8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/8fbd9346-5c58-40df-abdf-e2add12d0beb.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/4fe2e769-10f9-4327-bdfc-88ac84a34cc6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/cf7ce5c6-092b-4b77-9f5b-f62d5d723ea9.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5FuaWtvaWuCcLDOpaOaql2pv6axjKWmp59doa60wMinnmaolaezpq%2FTZpqopJ%2Bneq21z2aZrrFf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-goldstein-19641204-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Goldstein (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
