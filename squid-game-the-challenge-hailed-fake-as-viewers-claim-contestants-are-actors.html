There are elements that are dramatized for viewers, such as when contestants have false deaths, as they don’t actually get killed.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Black ink is used to ‘shoot’ the players to signify their elimination from the game. A total of 456 real-life players took part in the filming process, and weren’t allowed to communicate before production began.</p><p>The sets were all recreated in a London RAF base, and the money was real, along with real people. A total of 100,000 people applied for the <a href=#>Netflix</a> show, who came from entirely different backgrounds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-netflix-fans-accuse-show-of-hiring-actors>Netflix fans accuse show of hiring actors</h2><p>Some stars under talent agencies were hired for Squid: Game The Challenge, such as Chase Higgenz and Stephen Lomas, who are both under Joe Flowers Talent, an arts and entertainment agency.</p><p>Many of the cast have their own jobs, such as Beetle Campbell. He is a 27-year-old filmmaker who was scouted as a contestant for the show because he “ticked the box for redhead mountain kid”.</p><p>Beetle told us: “It wasn’t fake at all or scripted. Players were encouraged to stir the pot and ‘bait’. There are definitely some characters in there but they are all real people and no actors.”</p><p>Rumors are circulating that the series is scripted but the talking-head interviews compensate for the lack of scripted dialogue. Beetle says that “interactions are genuine despite some ‘playing up’ for cameras.”</p><p>Husnain, for example, returned to regular life after the show. The British accountancy graduate and TikToker left the competition early on, while Spencer is now a software developer and theater performer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@husnain_asif href=#>@husnain_asif</a><p>Is this part of the american dream ? nfl</p><a title="♬ original sound - Husnain asif" href=#>♬ original sound – Husnain asif</a></figure>View TikTok<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-contestant-says-series-felt-very-real>Contestant says series ‘felt very real’</h2><p>Contestant Beetle Campbell, who was eliminated by the second game, said the process “felt like a very real game” and weighed in on how the prize money is “life-changing.”</p><p>He described the filming process as “exhausting and very entertaining”. Beetle was in the series for two games, which took nine days. “They flew us to London and isolated us in hotels,” he told Reality Titbit.</p><p>“We weren’t allowed to speak to contestants in our hotel and had to wear face masks. They took us in lots of buses outside of London, went to an RAF base, and set up a huge set with the first game,” he added.</p><p>Beetle revealed what happens in the dorms. “We had one set of clothes, so we’d tie them up, start bowling with water bottles, and played volleyball. We found ways to pass time.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The fake dying though 🤣<a href=#>#SquidGameTheChallenge</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hgh6kQY0Sd</a></p>— ℝ𝕖𝕒𝕝𝕚𝕥𝕪 𝕋𝕍 CLiͥP MaͣcͨHiͥNeͤ (@RealityMemeMach) <a href=#>November 23, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH SQUID GAME: THE CHALLENGE ON NETFLIX NOW</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqLWww9JoqqqtmZl6qK3MnmStoJVisKmty6Wcp5%2BVYrWitcuem2aekaCybq3SZq2inaeav7R5wqWYoqVdmLyvwMSsq5qmpKh6or7EZpicrJ%2BnwA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kathlyn-celeste-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kathlyn Celeste Dating Now</span></a>
