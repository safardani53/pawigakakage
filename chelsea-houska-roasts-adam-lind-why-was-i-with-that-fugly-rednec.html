I honestly could not tell you where he’s at. I haven’t heard a single thing about him. He’s a ghost," Halbur said in an interview.</p><p>"I have no clue where he’s at or what he’s doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As with Aubree, Lind has surrendered his parental rights to daughter Paislee, and Taylor says she still doesn’t know what led him to that decision.</p><p>“I think child support was part of it. I don’t think that was 100 percent all of it," she told UK tabloid The Sun.</p><p>So while we don’t usually condone making fun of people on the basis of their appearance, we’re totally in favor of roasting a deadbeat dad like Adam Lind anytime the opportunity to do so presents itself.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WBcK%2FHnqOsnZFitbDB0qSYZqqflsC1v4yam5qlXaG2r7CMsJ%2ByZaeWwG61jLCgraBdqbWiwIyfrKCkqWK%2FprDNnppo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./warren-jeffs-son-roy-jeff-dead-suicide.html><span>←</span><span>Warren Jeffs' Son, Who Publicly Spoke Out About Father's Cult, Is Dead</span></a>
