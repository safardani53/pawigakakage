So probably best not call her lazy.</p><p>The star also has a string of books - everything from a guide to being a 'Towie' girl to her new-mum secrets - worth at least £750,000 and she signed a £250,000 deal with Pampers in 2019.</p><p>Sam also founded Essex favourite Minnie's Boutique, which Billie -

because all the while he's raking in a fortune.</p><p>As anyone who has seen his incredible house knows, the former Towie favourite, 33, is not short of a bob or two (or £8million).</p><p>He's appeared on every reality show going from his own hit Educating Joey Essex to I'm A Celeb, Celebs Go Dating, Celebrity SAS and pretty much any show that ever had 'Celebrity' in the title.</p><p>And he most recently made it to the <a href=#>final of Dancing On Ice</a>.</p><p>In the past he has had a clothing and hair products line and commands huge money for personal appearances.</p><p>Joey has also made six-figure sums by endorsing McDonalds, Jaffa Cakes and even soup and once released a song called Reem, though that's not thought to be a big contributor to his riches.</p><h2>Gemma Collins (£7M)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/NINTCHDBPICT000606691679.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023-london-england-barbie-cinemas-833040064.jpg><p>The reality rich list puts <a href=#>Gemma Collins</a> on an estimated £7.3million thanks to TV, endorsements and her own clothing line.</p><p>The 42-year-old former car dealer runs her own fashion empire, has a range with Boohoo and is renowned for landing big brand deals.</p><p>The 'meme queen' surprised everyone in 2017 when she popped up on Orange is the New Black to plug the show and has even been the face of an airline.</p><p>She's fronted her own show Diva Forever and presented on Loose Women and This Morning over the years since Towie.</p><p>Her endlessly quotable TV appearances on the likes of Big Brother - "I'm claustrophobic Darren" have appeared on all manner of products.</p><h2>Amy Childs (£5M)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/amy-childs-launches-salon-unit-707527076.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/5f12369e-c7af-47de-af08-4af287f3a147.jpg><p>She gifted humanity the 'vajazzle' and popularised the word 'hunny' as a form of punctuation -
