The Kardashians star shared a new post that included several photos and video clips of a camp-themed party she had for the adorable little girl, whose special day was on June 15, and her friends. The set up included balloons, camp-like tent beds, and even a private jet decked out to look like a campground, and the activities ranged from hiking to ziplining and tubing on the water.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“🪵 CAMP 🏕 NORTH 🪵,” Kim captioned the epic post, which received a lot of compliments from fans. “I wish I was a kid again,” one fan wrote while another called the party “awesome.” A third shared, “I wish I was friends with North” and a fourth pointed out that it was “the coolest birthday ever.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Before Kim shared pics and videos from North’s birthday party, she made headlines for reuniting with North’s dad, Kanye West, at a basketball game in Thousand Oaks, CA. The proud parents, who split last year, sat and intensely watched North playing the popular sport and were reportedly seen speaking to each other “a few times” throughout the game. Other than that, they hadn’t “made a big scene by cheering or much of anything else,” a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>source told TMZ</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kim-kardashian-north-west-birthday-party-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>When she’s not attending North’s activities and birthday parties, Kim is getting attention for spending time with her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>other three kids</a>, who include <strong>Saint</strong>, 6, <strong>Chicago</strong>, 4, and <strong>Psalm</strong>, 3. She brought along her sons to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her interview</a> on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon last week and made a memorable moment when she lightheartedly scolded them for “making so much noise” during the filming. “Guys! Guys, can you stop?” she said to them as the audience laughed. “This is like your first time at work with me. Can you please?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The camera then showed the tots sitting in seats near the stage with Kim’s pal&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tracy Romulus</strong></a>‘ daughter&nbsp;<strong>Remi</strong>. As they continued to be noisy, Kim continued to hilariously say, “Guys seriously you’ve gotta go.” Jimmy also tried to help by saying, “They can go back if you don’t feel like being out here. It’s fine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5FxZqenoqm1bsPErKtmrKWXtq%2BzjJ%2Bpop2emcBur8Cmp6Kml2KGtbSMm6CrrJiZrrp5z5qprbFdq7alsc5o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./morgan-heritage-jlxh-html.html><span>←</span><span>Morgan Heritage (Band) - Members profile, Facts, Wiki, Achievements, Net worth 2024 (updated)</span></a>
