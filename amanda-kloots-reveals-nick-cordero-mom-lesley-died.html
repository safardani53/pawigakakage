Sharing a carousel of photos of her mother-in-law, Lesley, over the years — some of which included Cordero — Kloots wrote, "My heart is broken to today. Nick's mother, my mother-in-law, Lesley Cordero, has passed away."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lesley and I got very close when Nick got sick. We were soldiers going to battle every day, fighting for the man we loved," she explained. "We traded hours at the hospital and comforted each others tears at night. She was a powerhouse, a woman of great strength and great advice. She was a huge help to me as a fellow widow, understanding how to navigate this new life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kloots then went on to describe Lesley's "very close" relationship with her late son, sharing that Cordero "talked to her pretty much every day."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Nick Cordero and Amanda Kloots.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He called her 'momsie.' Their relationship was one of the first things that I loved about Nick," she continued. "I admired their honesty, their friendship, and their incredible bond. Nick always encouraged Lesley's passion to be an artist. After losing her husband and Nick, she dove into her art and started a business selling her paintings all over the world."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "This one is hard for me. I don't know how to make sense of it, there actually isn't a way. It is not fair. This is when I absolutely hate death, loss and grief. My heart goes out to the Cordero family, literally the strongest family I know. I'm honored to know them, love them, and call them my brother and sister."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Closing out her emotional tribute, Kloots included a special message directed at Lesley: "Mom, my hope is that you are with Nick and Eduardo now, wrapped in their arms. That you are at peace - healthy, happy, no longer in any pain or suffering."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What you dealt with the last 6 years of your life was insurmountable but you still got up every day and kept living. You showed us all what courage looks like. You truly did Live Your Life," she continued, referencing her late husband's song. "You were the definition of resilience. I will miss you tremendously."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kloots added: "Thank you for loving me, taking me in as your daughter.
