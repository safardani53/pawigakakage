Years later, the actress — who <a href=#>shares sons</a> Noah, 10, Bodhi, 9, and Journey, 6, with her ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Brian Austin Green</strong></a> — revealed that the newfound attention the film brought her made for a <a href=#>“very dark” time in her life</a>.</p><p>“I think I had a genuine psychological breakdown where I wanted just nothing to do,” Fox told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a> in September 2019. “I didn’t want to be seen, I didn’t want to have to take a photo, do a magazine, walk a carpet, I didn’t want to be seen in public at all because the fear, and the belief, and the absolute certainty that I was going to be mocked, or spat at, or someone was going to yell at me, or people would stone me or savage me for just being out.”</p><p>In addition to being sexualized by “every producer” she worked with, the <a href=#>New Girl</a> alum noted that she felt excluded from the entertainment industry’s feminist community, even during the height of the #MeToo movement in 2017.</p><p>“What is <a href=#>supporting other females</a> if there is only certain ones of us we support?” she added at the time. “If I have to be an academic or have to be non-threatening to you in some way? Why can’t I be a part of the group as well?”</p><p><a href=#>Becoming pregnan</a>t was the “first real breakthrough” that helped her overcome those feelings. “My mind opened up and I was able to see from a birds-eye view and breath and take it in,” Fox continued. “And then another kid, and then another kid and with every kid I feel like that’s always been the doorway into a better version of myself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Fox and Green, 49, <a href=#>tied the knot in 2010</a> and welcomed their first child, Noah, two years later. One year after the Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen star gave birth to son Bodhi in 2014, she and the <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum <a href=#>called it quits</a> after 11 years together. <a href=#>The two reconciled</a> amid news of Fox’ third pregnancy in 2016, though the <a href=#>split again four years later</a> and <a href=#>finalized their divorce</a> in February 2022.</p><p>Fox went on to <a href=#>get engaged</a> to Machine Gun Kelly (real name Colson Barker) in January 2022. Green, for his part, <a href=#>welcomed son Zane</a>, 10 months, with <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>’ <a href=#><strong>Sharna Burgess</strong></a> that June.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamnZeWu26yzrFkp52mmr9uuM6vnJ1lmJq%2Fbq7OnbBmmZ2esW6w2KykqKqgnbaiedKtqa6fl6GytHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emma-hartley-miller.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Emma HartleyMiller net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
