1.50
FLAWLESS JEWEL should be hard to beat after being beaten by just a neck on debut at York last time. She knew her job there and this looks a lesser contest with Murqaab seemingly the only one to worry about.
2.30
LIFE KNOWLEDGE was a good second at Leicester last time and would have won in another couple of strides. That was over this distance and a 2lb rise in the weights looks fair."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

That was over this distance and a 2lb rise in the weights looks fair. <strong>Pentland Hills</strong> has been knocking on the door and was a good second at Leicester last time, which makes him the main danger.</p><p><strong>3.00</strong></p><p><strong>MICHELE STROGOFF</strong> has the benefit of the champion jockey in the saddle after a run of second places this season. He has not gone too far up the weights for those runs and was again right in the shake-up at Sandown latest. He has performed in better company and should go close.</p><h3><a href=#>GLORIOUS GOODWOOD LIVE <span>Get all you need for Glorious Goodwood with Sunracing's live blog</span></a></h3><p><strong>3.35</strong><br><strong>BIG COUNTRY</strong> can edge out <strong>Gabr</strong> with Silvestre De Sousa returning for the ride. He was on board for the Zetland Gold Cup win at Redcar in May and Michael Appleby has cheekpieces on the horse for the first time. He likes this shorter trip and should run well. <strong>Gabr</strong> is the obvious danger after a good second at Newmarket last time. A repeat of that would see him right in the picture.</p><p><strong>4.05</strong></p><p><strong>REQUINTO DAWN</strong> goes on any ground, which could be a big plus with all the rain around. He has been in good form this summer with a win at Catterick and a close second at the same track last time. He has no trouble seeing out this trip and should run well. <strong>Highly Sprung</strong> likes it here and has an excellent draw so can push him all the way.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest in horse racing</h2></p><p><strong>4.35</strong><br><strong>ROCK FORCE</strong> made a good start to his career at Newmarket last time, finishing strongly after taking a little time to get going. He should have learned from that and comes from a family that produces plenty of winners. <strong>Joie De Vivre</strong> wasn’t beaten far on debut at Carlisle, while <strong>Collide</strong> is a beautifully bred newcomer who should be watched closely in the betting.<br><strong>5.10</strong><br><strong>CANFORD BAY</strong> won at Wetherby last month and came back to that form when second at Haydock last time in a stronger race than this. He likes this trip and should go close again. <strong>Musharrif</strong> is on a long losing run but has been running well off this mark, with a good second at Beverley last time giving him every chance.</p><p><strong>UTTOXETER</strong><br>2.10 Get Ready Freddy<br>2.40 Adams Park<br>3.10 Monbeg Legend<br>3.45 Theatrebar<br>4.15 Imperial Presence<br>4.45 Thelunarschooner<br>5.20 Mrsrobin<br><strong>WOLVERHAMPTON</strong><br>1.20 Soldier Blue<br>1.50 Lassana Angel<br>2.20 Phoenix Of Spain<br>2.50 Documenting<br>3.20 Ventura Crest<br>3.55 Matchmaking<br>4.25 Lucifugous<br>5.00 Miss Mollie</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Love Island girls enjoy a day of races in the Ladies Day competition</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cIKXcWxuaGFkwbCwwLKqZp6imrJutM6rqp5lopawqrrGZquiqKNigHZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-ghazimorads-boyfriend-list.html><span>←</span><span>Tina Ghazimorads Boyfriend: Who is Tina Ghazimorad Dating?</span></a>
