All of the cliches have come true and exceeded well beyond my wildest expectations. It is hands down the best thing I have ever done in my entire life and I am completely in awe of our daughter.”</p><p>The news came six months after the Dirty Sexy Politics author revealed she and the Federalist cofounder, 39, were starting a family. “My husband Ben and I have been blessed to find out <a href=#>I’m pregnant</a>,” McCain told her Instagram followers in March 2020. “Although this isn’t how I expected to announce my pregnancy, both we and our families are excited to share the news with you all. I consulted with my doctors and they advised that for the safety of my baby and myself [amid the coronavirus pandemic], I should be extra vigilant about limiting the amount of people we come into contact with.”</p><p>She and Domenech, who<a href=#> wed in November 2017</a> in Arizona, chose to keep Liberty’s face hidden during her first couple of months. The pair only showed photos of the little one’s hands, the back of her head and her kicking feet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McCain explained in May 2020 that she was <a href=#>choosing to keep her family out of the spotlight</a> “as much as possible” because social media is a “cesspool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Meghan-McCain-Shows-Pic-of-3-Month-Old-Daughter-Liberty-Promo.jpg><p>The former Outnumbered host explained via Twitter at the time: “With being open and vulnerable about my personal life during my Dad [John McCain’s] cancer fight. It is a shame. I know this is an unorthodox choice for a talk show host who is on tv five days a week — but I’ve always lived by the beat of my own drum. Thank you for the continued kind words, support and prayers regarding my pregnancy from so many of you who are nothing but kind. It has meant a lot during this crazy time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGamnZedrq95zJyamqGeYsCpu9asZGqrpGK9qq%2BMqJ1mnJGqtKnAxKtkpaGSmr%2B1xdJmnZqblWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miguel-nunez-theologian.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Miguel Nez (theologian) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
