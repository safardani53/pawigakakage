And we’ve followed along with all the vacations, social media shout-outs, family outings, expensive gifts and roses (many roses) that entailed Kylie and Travis’ romance — now, let’s look back on all those great moments.</p><p>Kylie and Travis are pictured here at a Houston Rockets game in May 2017, just about a month after meeting! It was a whirlwind romance, since Kylie decided to follow Travis on his tour after Coachella. But they proved this wasn’t just a passionate fling — Kylie and Travis would go on to have many more romantic dates throughout 2017, and they even welcomed a baby girl, Stormi Webster, in Feb. 2018!</p><p>Stormi only strengthened Kylie and Travis’ relationship, and the family of three even united for many of Travis’ stops throughout his ‘Astroworld – Wish You Were Here Tour’ that kicked off in Nov. 2018. Although Travis had to deny rumors that he cheated on Kylie by early 2019, infidelity seemed impossible to imagine as they bounced back with more public shows of love. Travis, Kylie and Stormi — along with family and friends — even toured the European coastline for Kylie’s 22nd birthday in Aug. 2019!</p><p>The trip produced many happy photos of the then family of three, and the trio looked just as joyful on the red carpet for the Netflix premiere of ‘Travis Scott: Look Mom I Can Fly’ in Santa Monica on Aug. 27, 2019. That would be Travis and Kylie’s last public photo together before news of their first reported split arrived.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGinopujZLi6uMieZKOdnqOys3nTq5ivoaNiwKS7061kraGdmrmqusRmpp9lopq5osDIqKWsoJmlerO7zJqlnJ1dpbakv4ypn6isn6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pari-ehsan-19831128-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pari Ehsan (Blogger) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
