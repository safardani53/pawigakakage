Off screen, she has lived an equally as exciting life, getting engaged once, married once and having many <a href=#>high-profile romances</a> through the years.</p><p>Despite <a href=#>calling off their engagement</a> in 2000, <a href=#><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></a> continues to speak highly of the Cinderella Man actress, whom he calls the “great love” of his life.</p><p>“She was special to me, very special. I think she’s lovely,” the Mask actor said on <a href=#>The Howard Stern Show</a> in July 2020. “I don’t regret — I don’t have those things. But I do appreciate the people that have come through my life for the good that they gave me … but I don’t pine for anybody, it’s not that kind of situation. It’s just my way of saying, ‘There was a very important thing there,’ and to recognize that.”</p><p>Zellweger walked down the aisle in a private beach ceremony just five years after splitting from Carrey after a whirlwind romance with <a href=#><strong>Kenny Chesney</strong></a>. The pair <a href=#>split after four months of marriage</a> and the actress was quickly linked to multiple Hollywood heartthrobs, many of which she never actually dated.</p><p>During an <a href=#>interview with W magazine</a> in November 2007, Zellweger and longtime friend<a href=#><strong> George Clooney </strong></a>joked about how long they’ve been married as fans continued to ship them as a couple. “35 [years],” Clooney said, while Zellweger joked, “We’ve been married 28.”</p><p>The Ocean’s Eleven star fired back, “Twenty-seven. We lived together the first year. It was a lot of fighting.”</p><p>The <a href=#>My Own Love Song actress</a> chimed in, “But we saved on rent. And I fed the dogs and pigs. I vacuumed too.” Clooney added, “That’s true. I was a younger leading man, and she was an ingenue.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The same year, Zellweger was rumored to be seeing <a href=#><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a>, but the actress denied they were anything more than acquaintances. “He’s as lovely as I expected. We have mutual friends. The crush and I have mutual friends,” she told <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2007.</p><p>Scroll down to see which men Zellweger has dated over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv6a6xJ5ks52cocSms8Srqmackam2r7OMoaCsrJ%2Bnxm68x6irqKtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-the-grocery-store-in-guys-grocery-games-real.html><span>←</span><span>Is the Grocery Store in 'Guy's Grocery Games' Real?
