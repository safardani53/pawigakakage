He and wife Miranda Caldwell share eight kids together.</h2><p>Luke may be well-known for his skills when it comes to fixing up houses, but his efforts as a family man are equally if not even more so commendable.

He adds that having so many loved ones "is the greatest treasure [he] could ever attain in this lifetime."</p><p>Luke and Miranda were teenage sweethearts who decided to tie the knot on June 30, 2002. Ever since then, they've been focused entirely on building and maintaining a large and loving family unit.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, trips that Luke and Miranda took earlier in life (to India and Romania, respectively) opened their eyes to how dire the situations were for a lot of orphaned children worldwide. These powerful scenes instilled in them a will to become adoptive parents as they grew older.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Over the years, Luke and Miranda developed a relationship with a specific Chinese orphanage, starting with the adoption of their son, Morris. The couple went on to adopt four children from that one location, all of whom have special needs.</p><p>Luke told People that the process has been both challenging and rewarding, saying, "It takes time to build that bond, build that trust and build that connection with your child, it doesn’t happen overnight. That’s probably the hardest thing."</p><p>Through hard work, devout faith, and lots of love, Luke and Miranda's family has come a long way over the last decade. On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, Luke makes sure to keep his many fans updated on the happenings in his personal life. He shares the immense level of affection he has for Miranda and his kids on a fairly regular basis online.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Family aside, Luke is also in a band that makes Christian music.</h2><p>One of the lesser-known aspects of Luke's life is his affinity for music. The HGTV star is the lead member of a band called Luke Caldwell, named after him. Previously, the group was known as Grand Prize and then later known as Esterlyn. They are a Christian worship band that released their debut album "Call Out" in 2010, selling more than 25,000 units as independent artists.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>With a focus on Christian ministry, missions, and child adoption, the Luke Caldwell group performs mainly at Christian events and churches.
