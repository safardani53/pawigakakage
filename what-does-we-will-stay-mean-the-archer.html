Ok, no we obviously weren't attending every performance (lol that definitely was not in the budget), but we have lived vicariously through every single TikTok that has come across our FYP keeping us fed with content.</p><p>But we get that Taylor needed a break. We mean, if we can call it that. Not only did Taylor release a record-breaking movie and a new album in the two months off, but she also somehow found the time for a new budding relationship with Travis Kelce.</p><p>That said, our wait is finally over and The Eras Tour is back baby! The fans at her first stop in Argentina decided to surprise her with "We Will Stay" signs during her song "The Archer." What does it mean?

Not only did Taylor have to postpone her second performance due to bad weather, but her new boyfriend Travis was there to support our queen and the fans had a special surprise for her during the song "The Archer."</p><p>"The Archer" was noticeably missing from The Eras Tour movie (most likely cut for time), but it is the very last song at the end of her Lover era set. In the song, she ponders the complexities of her life and sings, "who could ever leave me darling, but who could stay?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>More specifically, the chorus goes:</p><p>I've been the archer I've been the prey Who could ever leave me, darling? But who could stay?</p><p>At the very end of the song, she switches the "who could stay?" for "you could stay," in a wordplay that is very typical of Taylor's songwriting.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>During the last part of "The Archer," fans in the audience, including famous TikToker Chris Olsen, held up "We Will Stay" signs in response to Taylor's question, "Who could stay?"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>From the video, you can see that Taylor is very touched and overjoyed, grabbing her heart in reaction to the signs, and as she is lowered from the stage mouths, "Te amo," to the crowd.</p><p>Do you know who else held up a "We Will Stay" sign? Travis Kelce.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Travis holds his "We Will Stay" sign proudly over his head as he dances to the music cheering on our girl and also telling her at the same time that he will stay. We're obsessed and 100% here for this couple.</p><p>(P.S. Taylor, we will always stay.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydpp6rXayybsPIpaNmq6SWxm65xJqlZqyYmnqivsKhnKs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwyry0w3oagzisshqoex-tnnmvybo-tj.html><span>←</span><span>Watch The Fairly OddParents Season 7 Episode 10: Double Oh Schnozmo/Planet Poof</span></a>
