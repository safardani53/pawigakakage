I don’t really care,” she said in her Snapchat as she chews on a pretzel. “I’m just letting them have fun.”</p><p><span>But since one of those moments of fun (alongside a declaration that “i love being so famous with no talent”) related to the existence of a sex tape, Jenner thought she’d just shut that rumor down quick.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kylie-jenner-19be8d12-5c3c-413f-9ce0-41e31fdaddc2.jpg><p><span>“Well my sex tape with tyga was trash,” the fake Kylie Jenner tweeted.</span></p><p><span>“Everyone is like ‘leak the sex tape,'” Jenner said in her second video. “Guys, you are never going to see a sex tape from me. It’s not going to happen.”</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>Jenner is the latest celebrity to face the awkwardness of a Twitter hack. Last week </span><b><a href=#>Katy Perry</a></b><span> was a </span><a href=#>victim</a><span>, with her hacker stirring up old beef between herself and </span><b><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></b><span>.</span></p><p><span>Jenner’s hacker played along with the same joke during her string of false messages. “Miss u both @taylorswift13 @katyperry,” the mystery hacker tweeted.</span></p><p>But while some of the hacker’s posts were harmless celeb-land gags, others totally crossed the line, with racist and lewd outbursts. The messages have now been deleted.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm62xKelnqpdqa6tt9Jmq7ChpKmys3nHmpqkZaOaxW7AwKmcZq%2BZqbVuwNigmGavYmWFeYOYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenn-potthast-claps-back-at-90-day-fiance-fans-moldovans-do-eat.html><span>←</span><span>Jenn Potthast Claps Back at 90 Day Fiance Fans: Moldovans DO Eat Peasant Food!</span></a>
