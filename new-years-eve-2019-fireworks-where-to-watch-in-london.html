You cannot move between these areas, and anyone that leaves their specific area will not be allowed to re-enter.</p><p>It has been advised attendees should arrive between 8-10pm, as all areas will fill up quickly by the 100,000 people who have bought tickets.</p><p>Instead, there are plenty of other ticketed and free events for you to catch the capital's greatest sky display of the year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More in news</h2></p><h2>Where else am I able to watch the fireworks?</h2><p>If you are unable to get to the viewpoints, or would simply like a bit more comfort and party with your side of fireworks, there are several other options to enjoy the midnight visual delights.</p><ul><li>Cannon Street: Nestled in between St Paul's Cathedral, Mansion House and Bank, and just outside the ticketed area so it's free. Here you've still got a great view of the river and can catch all of the fireworks from above. Keep an eye on TfL for updates, but the station usually shuts around 8pm so plan well!</li><li>Tower Bridge: Just around the corner from the main display area of Waterloo, this area is also free but gives a clear view of the magnificent</li><li>Parliament Hill: Set further away from the action, but will still give you a clear view, and a lot less likely to be crowded. Perfect if you have little kiddies to keep sight of.</li><li><a href=#>Pergola Kensington Olympia</a>: Referring to itself as a Botanical Bolthole, this rooftop venue boasts views of the London skyline and is ticketed at just £10. With the warmth of a roof, heaters and glass sides you can both enjoy the sights and take your coat off. All while sipping on a beverage. Lovely! It's also open yearly, and in summer turns into a tropical cabana to fill your needs of sunshine and socialising with friends.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3B9A5704.jpg><p>Seems like there's lots of places for us to go and sing 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?' with our loved ones in the capital after all.</p><p>So happy new year 2019!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbX1zgZdxamimlax6urHAq6pmnaaaenN8kHJkn6GimsSwvsqsZLCglaeybsDOZq6arJOdeqq6jKWmp5yfo3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-shocked-website-dedicated-beautiful-feet-four-toes.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian is shocked by website dedicated to her 'beautiful' FEET after fans accuse her of havi</span></a>
