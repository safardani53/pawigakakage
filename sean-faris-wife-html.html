The ambiance was filled with a hue of blue while a warm light shot straight at their faces in perfect focus.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It would appear that Faris was too engrossed in his wife's company even to notice that his arms almost blocked the lens. Evidently, the wife was just as lost as he was.&nbsp;</p><p>The second snap in the post must have been taken not long after the first one. While the two had broken off their kiss, their love for one another was just as radiant.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They were still facing one another, eyes closed, simply relishing in the presence of one another. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Sean Faris & Wife Celebrate Marriage Anniversary Over a Picnic in Paris</h2><p>The couple celebrated their seventh anniversary almost two months after they celebrated their fourth marriage anniversary. Faris took to Instagram to give fans a peek into how they celebrated their fourth year as man and wife.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On October 31, 2021, Faris shared a couple of snaps of his wife.&nbsp;Jimenez was dressed in an off-white shortdress as she sat cross-legged. Apparently, the couple celebrated their anniversary with a picnic out in Paris.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The wife raised her cup, possibly to her husband, who was behind the camera. The second snap featured in the post had pretty much the exact details, just that instead of the slight smile adorning her face, it was a pout. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Not Your Typical Wedding</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After about four years of dating, Faris and his wife exchanged vows&nbsp;at Burning Man – the Black Rock Desert's annual art and music celebration.</p><p>The groom later announced via an Instagram post that framed the newly-wed couple just as they took their vows.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The couple also didn't go with the traditional wedding attire for their special day. The groom donned a pair of&nbsp;patterned shorts and complimented it by throwing&nbsp;a fur stole over his shoulders. A&nbsp;chunky gold necklace and cuff as accessories completed his wedding look. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As for the bride, she chose to go with&nbsp;white lace lingerie and a sheer white robe, topped off with a metal headpiece.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Sean Faris' Marriage Has Not Been All Rainbows & Sunshine</h2><p>In the years they have spent together, the couple seems to have nurtured one another and helped each other grow.</p><p>On October 1, 2021, Faris put up a candid post where he admitted that his relationship with his wife hadn't always been smooth sailing.</p><p>He believed that happy couples weren't just the ones posting endearing posts, but also those who supported one another through trauma, opened up for uncomfortable conversations, and, not to forget, those who have cried to save their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>In the caption, he thanked his wife for doing all of that and more and shared that he was grateful to have someone like her to walk back home to.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuVlrtussCroKxlp56zpnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jordan-herring-19880301-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jordan Herring (TikTok Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
