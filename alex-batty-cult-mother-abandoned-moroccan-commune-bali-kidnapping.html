Melanie's mum, Susan Caruana, was Alex's legal guardian and was expecting him home after just a week in Marbella.
But Alex did not return from the trip, and Melanie sent Susan a video message saying he would not be coming home because she wanted him to follow her lifestyle."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Alex’s home and school are here. I love and miss him so much.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><br><p>On Thursday, six years after he vanished, <a href=#>Alex escaped a commune in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains</a> and fled on foot until a lorry driver picked him up.</p><p>He was able to identify himself to police and is now expected to <a href=#>return back to his home in the UK on Saturday</a>.</p><p>He <a href=#>told his roadside rescuer "my mum kidnapped me when I was 12"</a>, and said that she "is a little crazy", but would not reveal her location.</p><p>Susan previously revealed in 2018 that her daughter Melanie was a rebellious teenager, partying hard and drinking.</p><p>She and her husband, David, struggled to cope with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Melanie later went to university and got a law degree but couldn’t hold down a job. And in 2006, she had a son, Alex.</p><p>Susan said: "I lived nearby, and I saw Alex every day, I looked after him a lot and we had such a close bond.</p><p>"I loaned loads of money to Melanie, to care for Alex, but she just blew the lot."</p><p>Susan and David by this point had separated, and he was in therapy for health issues. Afterwards, Susan said he changed dramatically.</p><p>She explained: "Dave went through therapy and afterwards he began acting strangely.</p><p>"He became very spiritual.&nbsp;He didn’t believe in working any more and so he fell behind with his mortgage and bills and the bailiffs were called in.</p><p>"Melanie became caught up with his new lifestyle too and she got involved with a cult.</p><p>"She began travelling abroad, with Alex. Their lives were chaotic. Melanie didn’t believe in school or education. I was really worried about them."</p><p>Susan said: “I was devastated. I was so close to Alex and I missed him terribly. From Facebook I could see that the conditions there were terrible.</p><p>“Then, Melanie went off to live in Bali with a new boyfriend, leaving Alex behind. I was panic-stricken and I paid for a flight home for him.”</p><p>It was then that Alex began living with Susan.</p><p>Melanie remained in Bali and spoke to her son intermittently on Skype.</p><p>Susan said: “I got Alex into a local school in Oldham and he was really settled and happy. He was so pleased to have a home.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/KH-MAP-MYSTERY-SOLVEDv4.webp> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/kidnapped-alex-batty-brainwashed-mum-866418858-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/british-teen-alex-batty-told-866321668-1.jpg><p>The concerned grandmother then applied to the courts for guardianship of Alex, but Melanie refused to recognise the court action.</p><p>Susan shockingly revealed: "She returned home – and I paid for her flight.</p><p>"She refused to co-operate with the courts, but she sent me an invoice for £500,000 for use of her ‘property’ – Alex.</p><p>"I was horrified. It was so upsetting."</p><p>Susan was eventually awarded guardianship of Alex in 2016. Melanie refused to attend court for the ruling.</p><p>Despite Melanie's strained relationship with both her mum and her son - Susan still wanted the pair to maintain a relationship of some kind.</p><p>Susan said: "I was happy for Melanie to see Alex, I wanted to them to have contact. But her lifestyle was still chaotic."</p><p>In October 2017, Melanie asked if she could take Alex away on holiday to Marbella.</p><p>Susan said: "I was very torn. I was worried about her taking him. But Alex was desperate to go on holiday with his mum. I didn’t want to let him down.</p><p>"I’d had to cancel a holiday earlier in the year because I’d been in hospital, so it seemed very cruel to deny him the opportunity.</p><p>"Dave said he would go along too. I trusted him. I never thought he would lie to me or compromise Alex’s safety."</p><p>Horrifyingly, Susan revealed that Alex called her from the holiday before his mother broke of all contact between them.</p><p>"During the holiday, Alex called me, and said he was on the beach," she said.</p><p>"But in the background, I heard his mum shout: Switch the phone off. No more contact.</p><p>"My heart dropped. I was frantic."</p><p>It was then that Melanie sent the video message to Susan - telling her that she would not see her grandson return home.</p><p>Susan said: “I was heartbroken. I blamed myself because I had trusted them with him.</p><p>"On the video, Alex said it was a million times better being with his mum and granddad. It hurt me a bit, but I knew he was just being a kid, enjoying the freedom.”</p><p>At the time, Susan said all she wanted was to know that her grandson was safe.</p><p>She said: "I am beyond angry and upset with Melanie. She has let me down so many times and this has broken our relationship for good."</p><p>And she had not heard from him since, until the pair were able to speak on Thursday after his escape in France this week.</p><p>Speaking from her home in Oldham, Gtr&nbsp;<a href=#>Manchester</a>, she said: “I am so happy. I have spoken to him and he is well."</p><p>British cops are reportedly preparing to arrest his mum Melanie and grandad David after the alleged abduction.</p><p>A focus of the enquiry is a claim that Alex’s mother did not want him to go to school, said a French police source.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>The teen was apparently living with no formal teaching or health care.</p><p>It is understood the off-grid commune where he was is completely isolated from mainstream society and has no schools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/i-lived-nearby-i-saw-866449340-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2017-found-france-authorities-say-866304297.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-shows-missing-british-schoolboy-866434780-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2018-grandmother-missing-schoolboy-believes-384674310.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ4JxgpJrbGtnkaGyuXnBmqutsV2Ywq3AjKamraCVp3qirsCnm6imlZl6rrvRqJqcmZ5isLC5zK6lnmWSlrmqecqim6eZoKW2r7OO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josh-allen-girlfriend-html.html><span>←</span><span>Facts to Know about Josh Allens Girlfriend Brittany Williams</span></a>
