Additionally, Chris held onto a purple leash that was attached to his canine companion, uniquely named Wednesday Weld — who Chris <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>adopted in 2016</a>, from&nbsp;Home Dog LA’s North Central Animal Shelter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chris-Pine-shirtless-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>He was later photographed (shirt-on) with his dog at a local shop. That time, Chris sported a cut-off tee that read “Miami Vice” on the front. He was pictured squinting from the bright LA rays and reaching for his sunglasses. The fairly private star is rarely photographed out and about in LA, where he lives and works. Chris joins a slew of male stars — including <strong>Dwyane Wade</strong>, <strong>Shawn Mendes</strong>, <strong>Blake Griffin</strong>, <strong>Niall Horan</strong> and more — who’ve recently been spotted <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>working out shirtless</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>When he’s not hitting the pavement for a sweat session, Chris is most likely on a movie set. The busy actor currently has three films in post-production, as well as another in pre-production. The films&nbsp;Violence of Action, Don’t Worry Darling and All the Old Knives are all in post-production. Newslash is in pre-production at this time. The latter doesn’t even include Chris’ other announced films, Dungeons and Dragons and a&nbsp;Star Trek sequel&nbsp;that has yet to receive a title.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FrZpygop7AbrzIp5xmq5iev7W4xKyqZqiYpMGwv4yorK2cn6S%2FbsPOq6KoraRisbCzjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./madeline-brewer-19920501-html.html><span>←</span><span>Madeline Brewer (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
