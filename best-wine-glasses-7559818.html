The best wine glasses should feel delicate but balanced in your hand, and they should encourage the flavors in each wine to open up freely. Bonus points if they look chic while doing it. Wine glasses vary greatly in price and style, and there are a ton of varieties to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In search of the best wine glasses for red, white, sparkling wine, and everything in between, we put some of the leading models through a series of tests and spoke to wine educator and certified sommelier Sarah Tracey. We sipped, sniffed, and swirled in search of a glass that helped accentuate aromas and deliver complex flavors while feeling comfortable and sturdy in our hands.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wine glasses are inherently delicate, but they should be durable enough to use repeatedly. Although the best wine glass for you will depend on your drinking style and personal preference, we sought to find functional, stylish, and sturdy glasses. “Different shapes of wine glasses do show off different attributes of a wine — and though the differences may be subtle, they’re absolutely part of the experience of enjoying wine to its fullest,” Tracey said.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for some of the best wine glasses PEOPLE Tested.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-gabriel-glas-standart-crystal-wine-glasses-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gabriel-Glas StandArt Crystal Wine Glasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Gabriel-Glas Austrian Crystal Wine Glass StandArt Edition (Set of 2)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/tBAv3J8imlkePdXU-0G_SXRRKOo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gabriel-Glas-Austrian-Crystal-Wine-Glass-StandArt-Edition-Set-of-2-790bb0fdc80742d4a5153beddacb937e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Thickness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>This glass is thick and sturdy while still maintaining delicate elegance.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Its universal shape and thinner lip make it great for drinking all types of wine.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It's gorgeous enough for a special occasion but also durable enough to use every day.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This completely universal glass is fancy enough for special occasions but durable enough to use every day. The lead-free crystal is strong yet slim, so it’s thin against your lips but thick and sturdy in your hand. Though the stem is shorter than some other wine glasses we tested, the universal-style bowl is well balanced with the stem, so the weight of the wine distributes evenly when tipping the glass towards your mouth. Throughout testing, we found that these glasses were ideally proportioned and elegant no matter what type of wine we were pouring. They’re lovely to look at, and the tapered bowl is strategically designed to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>help open the wine’s aroma</a> and direct it upwards and out of the glass.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The set of two strong glasses comes at a super affordable price, making this an elegant and cost-effective purchase for any type of wine drinker. Whether you have a glass every night or enjoy the occasional sip, these glasses are ideal for everyday-drinking and special occasions alike.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bowl Type: </strong>Universal |<strong> Stem:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>Number of Glasses Included:</strong> 2</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="Two glasses of wine inside of Gabriel-Glas Austrian Crystal Wine Glass StandArt Edition glasses" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ylSloJ0GIVJi5Dd-IP6dQKuqD-s=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-gabriel-glas-standart-crystal-wine-glass-set-of-2-8-rkilgore-113-45162781ca68439694bca39c5363ddd5.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="A Gabriel-Glas Austrian Crystal Wine Glass StandArt Edition glass holding white wine" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pY3Yl3VlviPh2YX9dgrbKBJlVCk=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-wine-glasses-test-gabriel-glas-standart-crystal-set-6-rkilgore-52-987f3dc63dde4a4f8dea8f76f909863b.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-universal-zalto-denkart-universal-hand-blown-wine-glass></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Universal</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zalto Denk'Art Universal Wine Glass</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wine Enthusiast Zalto Denk&amp;acirc;Art Universal Glass" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/YHzmR15aXIsmAy7LyfRGoYLQOnk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/zalto-denkart-universal-glass-8ba0acdcf0434384870ad41f1c72177d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wine Enthusiast</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Thickness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>The versatile shape of these glasses means they’re ideal for serving any type of wine.</p></li><li readability=0><p>These glasses take the place of multiple pieces of glassware — which helps cut down on dirty dishes and streamline storage.</p></li><li readability=0><p>Though they’re super dainty, they’re still durable enough to put in the dishwasher.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>These are on the pricey end.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Because this glass is so lightweight, it’s best for special-occasion wine drinkers who want to savor a special glass — it’s not ideal for everyday drinking.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it can be nice to have specific glasses for every type of wine, it’s even nicer to have a versatile glass that can support any type of wine, while cutting down on dirty dishes in the process. Universal glasses are designed to support everything from red to white to sparkling wines all in the convenience of one glass, so you don’t need to keep multiple sets stored in your cabinets. We love this option for serving all types of wine because it’s elegant and dainty while proving to be versatile and durable. The glass itself is thin and lightweight, so you can feel the weight of the wine when you swirl it around. The generous bowl and tapered lip performed exceptionally well in our tests — we were able to identify nuanced and complex aromas when assessing the nose of each wine, and were also able to pick up more complexity in wines when tasted out of this glass versus other glasses.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that these wine glasses are particularly lightweight and dainty. They’re not ideal for casual drinkers looking for a glass they can toss in the dishwasher every night. These are on the pricier side, so they’re better suited to wine drinkers who like to sip, savor, and take special care of their stemware.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bowl Type: </strong>Universal |<strong> Stem:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>Number of Glasses Included:</strong> 2</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-2 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="Two Zalto DenkâArt Universal Wine Glasses" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/mxpWl7uq2Q0vilHY-pPDdcd9bsw=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-zalto-denkart-universal-wine-glass-set-of-2-2-rkilgore-044-ff6adeaec6a440e2a6d5f2fd0b054088.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="A close up of a hand holding red wine contained in a Zalto DenkâArt Universal Wine Glass" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/pXZSSTq_u3DIkJ4pjnxUqKTSm2s=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-wine-glasses-test-zalto-denkart-universal-set-2-rkilgore-12-efe578329d104d669670d2e47f53ee29.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-zwiesel-glas-verbellevervino-wine-glasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zwiesel Glas Verbelle Wine Glasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Zwiesel Glas Schott Zwiesel Verbelle Wine Glasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2nlgSYvVwCFIdZ72l9Bcd3TCgqk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Zwiesel-Glas-Schott-Zwiesel-Verbelle-Wine-Glasses-53705ef3b38241ed84fb17191c2490a8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Thickness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>These elegant glasses come in a set of six.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>They’re sturdy with long stems that add elegance.</p></li><li readability=1><p>You can choose from seven different shapes including stemless, tall stemless, or universal.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Stemware can get pricey, so if you’re looking to cut costs, opt for these high-quality crystal glasses that come in a set of six. Available in a variety of styles and shapes — like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Sauvignon blanc, or sparkling — stemmed or stemless —&nbsp; these chic glasses are even cheaper than some other sets that only offer two glasses. Schott Zwiesel is known throughout the wine industry for making elegant glassware, and we can see why. These glasses stood up to all of our tests and looked stylish in the process. The sharp geometric shape is a fun divergence from traditional round bowls, which makes them a little more stylish than regular wine glasses.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were able to detect complex aromas from the tapered stems, and the beaded rim felt soft and sturdy against our lips. The long stem adds elegance, and the titanium-infused crystal is extra durable. We love that the stem and bowl are well balanced, and although it feels a little heavier in our hands than some others, the base, stem, and bowl feel durable and strong.</p><p><strong>Bowl Type: </strong>Universal, Red, White, or Sparkling |<strong> Stem:</strong> Stem or Stemless | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> Yes | <strong>Number of Glasses Included:</strong> 6</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-4 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="Two Schott Zwiesel Verbelle Wine Glasses - Universal Glass on a table next to wine bottles and a cheese platter" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/rDEYAq3Ry-oGAmFQLAT-GT8KBho=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-schott-zwiesel-verbelle-wine-glasses-set-6-5-rkilgore-091-59ccd9ae37c741399d0175a9ddba7885.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2668 data-sizes=750px alt="A close up shot of wine inside of two Schott Zwiesel Verbelle Wine Glasses" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/P2E_VV3DasmgupJnXEJLlZo-Igc=/fit-in/1500x2668/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-wine-glasses-test-schott-zwiesel-verbelle-set-6-rkilgore-55-0e7356949c9c4469a8a225dd56aa4da4.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-entertaining-schott-zwiesel-forte-claret-burgundy-wine-glass-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Entertaining</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Schott Zwiesel Forte Wine Glasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Schott Zwiesel Tritan Crystal Glass Banquet Collection Claret Burgundy Red Wine Glass" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5AgQjaX90Wux_oYum2lToJ_m94k=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/schott-zwiesel-tritan-crystal-glass-banquet-collection-claret-burgundy-red-wine-glass-e689d22b1af147e19eecc76066dc2d93.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Appearance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Thickness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Weight</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=0><p>With six wine glasses included, this is a great option to stock up at an affordable price.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The classic, timeless design suits a lot of different bottles, so it’s incredibly versatile.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The glasses are sturdy and durable.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to stock up on wine glasses for an upcoming party or holiday without breaking the bank, six glasses in a set make these an incredible buy. The design is classic and timeless, and this standard glass suits a lot of different wine varietals and can be used in a variety of settings. We found that these glasses felt strong and sturdy in our hands thanks to the durable Tritan glass that’s dishwasher-safe.

Riedel makes some of the best glasses in the wine industry, and the brand’s timeless shapes and high-quality crystal are revered among sommeliers and everyday wine drinkers alike. The Veloce line is thin and delicate, so it looks elegant but feels balanced in your hand from base to rim. These glasses are made from the same high-quality crystal as other Riedel glassware, but these are machine-made to offer an even more precise design at a reasonable price. We found that when drinking red out of these glasses, we were able to detect complex aromas on the nose and nuanced flavors on the palate.

They’re specifically designed with a unique shape that helps accentuate aromas. The wide base allows for ample oxygen exposure, so wines can more easily open up and breathe, allowing aromatics to more easily travel toward your nose — which is a trait we noticed across all of the wines we tested.

Because of the dedicated design, these glasses are best suited to bold red wines that should be swirled and decanted.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Bowl Type: </strong>Red |<strong> Stem:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dishwasher Safe:</strong> No | <strong>Number of Glasses Included:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-editors-pick-anthropologie-morgan-wine-glasses></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Editor's Pick</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Morgan Wine Glasses</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=960 data-sizes=750px alt="Morgan Wine Glasses" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/fkgPrVXax3tB2S4PyAobvC0n4r4=/fit-in/1500x960/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/76142504_066_b-cf6a6bf194844d20b9d145b7c3da56a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>These uniquely shaped glasses come in 10 different colors.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The fun, chic look doubles as décor on open shelving.</p></li><li readability=0><p>These glasses are affordable, and the customer service is top-notch.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>These glasses are very lightweight and fragile, so they must be handled with care.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>These are more decorative-type glasses for the occasional wine drinker.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We didn't test these colorful Anthropologie wine glasses in the lab, but after our resident food and wine writer wrote this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wine lover gift guide</a>, one of our editors bought a set of these Morgan glasses as a holiday gift to herself.

"I'm not a serious wine drinker, so I can't say how these glasses help reveal the 'notes' of the wine or not, but they look adorable on my open shelving and serve their purpose when entertaining guests or winding down from a long day," says Johnson.

When it comes to red wines, look for a glass with a large bowl — the extra surface area in the bowl will allow more of the wine to be exposed to oxygen, which will help the aromas open up and “breathe.” A tapered, tulip-like rim will help aromas funnel up from the wine and out of the glass, so you can more easily sniff and savor them. Our favorite glass for drinking red wine is the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Riedel Veloce Cabernet glass</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for a versatile glass that can suit multiple different varietals, a universal glass (like our <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">best overall pick</a>) is your best bet. These all-purpose wine glasses are ideal for serving red, white, or sparkling wines, and having a few do-it-all pieces in your collection can help cut down on dirty dishes and save space on your bar cart.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Care and Cleaning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Caring for wine glasses properly is the best way to get the most use out of them. Some of the most elegant wine glasses are also the most fragile, so be sure to keep maintenance in mind when shopping. Although many wine glasses are designated dishwasher-safe, you’ll want to pay special attention to where you plan to place them in the dishwasher and sink. If you’re willing to spend extra time washing your glassware by hand, you can absolutely invest in dainty, lightweight, and elegant glasses. If you’re looking for an everyday glass that can be placed in the dishwasher after a long day, make sure to shop for dishwasher-safe glasses that are on the thicker, more sturdy side.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to storage, Tracey recommends storing your extra-special glasses carefully. “If you have really nice glasses that only come out for special occasions, you may want to store them in the box they came in. Otherwise, just keeping them in a cabinet is fine,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Weight and Balance</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Balance and weight are two factors that are extremely important when assessing the best wine glasses. Lightweight glasses often feel more dainty and elegant than bulkier alternatives, so they make it easy to sip and swirl delicately. In addition to the weight of the glass itself, it’s important to assess the weight of each piece — the base, stem, and bowl — and to understand how they interact with one another. If a glass is top-heavy, it’s easy to spill and makes the drinking process uncomfortable. If a glass is bottom-heavy, it will be more difficult to tilt, swirl, and drink from. Whether you prefer a lightweight and delicate glass or a heavier, more durable alternative, make sure the weight is balanced from base to rim.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To start the testing process we gathered 24 different wine glasses — 12 strictly red wine glasses and 12 universal-style glasses — and sampled one glass of red, one glass of white, and one glass of sparkling wine in each glass. Throughout our tests, we sought to examine design, durability, size, and overall value. To assess the design, we examined each glass’s overall appearance, paying special attention to the thickness of the rim, stem, bowl, and base. By holding the glasses in our hands we examined the overall weight of the glass and determined how balanced or unbalanced it felt from base to rim. While weight is usually a good indicator of durability, we also ran each dishwasher-safe glass through a dishwashing cycle to get a good idea of how sturdy each glass was. We examined each glass after the dishwashing cycle and noted any chips, scratches, or breaks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To assess functionality and size, we examined how each glass impacted each wine’s aroma. While some glasses helped the wine open up and become aromatic, others had no impact on the wine’s aromas whatsoever, even when pouring from the same bottle. We also assessed the length of each stem and noted whether or not the stem length had any impact on ease of use or functionality. We then rated each glass on a scale of one to five (with five being the best) and the top performers made this list.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-7bedb54c-43a9-4a18-b494-456d755f121e></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.283582089552><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97204968944099><p><span class=accordion__title>Do expensive wine glasses make a difference?</span></p><p>As is the case with any piece of kitchen or home equipment, it’s important to assess your needs before investing in an expensive item. “Expensive glassware is much like any luxury item: perhaps it’s handcrafted, or made from incredibly expensive materials. It may be the packaging or the prestige associated with the brand. All of these things contribute to the price, and customers will buy those brands if they align with their needs, wants, and values,” Tracey said.</p><p>If you’re an experienced wine drinker who wants to get the most out of every sip and sniff, a more expensive glass that feels lightweight and balanced in your hand makes the drinking experience much more pleasant. More expensive glasses are typically designed with wine tasting in mind — so they should have a wide bowl that allows the wine to breathe and open up. If you’re an occasional drinker who wants a sturdy glass they can bring out for parties and put right in the dishwasher, you probably don’t need to invest in expensive glasses.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that not every expensive glass is better than a cheaper alternative — there are plenty of glasses (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Schott Zwiesel Verbelle Wine Glasses</a>) that are affordable and functional at the same time.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98915009041591><p><span class=accordion__title>Are Riedel glasses worth it?</span></p><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Riedel</a> makes industry-approved stemware that is beloved in restaurants and home kitchens alike.

If you’d like to streamline your storage and cut down on the number of dirty dishes you have, try opting for universal glasses that can suit a wide variety of wines.
