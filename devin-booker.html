His parents are <strong>Melvin Booker</strong> and <strong>Veronica</strong> <strong>Gutiérrez</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>His father is a former basketball point guard who played for the&nbsp;</span><strong>Grand Rapids Hoops</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span>Continental Basketball Association<span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Likewise, he was the </span>Big Eight Player of the Year&nbsp;in&nbsp;1994.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Melvin had entered the&nbsp;</span><strong>1994 NBA Draft</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true> but went undrafted. He says it was one of the worst nights of his life to this date.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Devin-Booker-when-he-was-a-kid.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, he eventually played in the&nbsp;</span>NBA<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;</span>Houston Rockets, Denver Nuggets, <span data-preserver-spaces=true>and the</span>Golden State Warriors.&nbsp;</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, his mother is a cosmetologist. Booker has a close and special bond with his mother.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Veronica has always encouraged her son to express his love for basketball. Likewise, Melvin has also praised her for being a great co-parent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But his parents were never married. Nevertheless, they were a great parenting team, and they have co-parented Devin since he was eight months old.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Devin learned everything about basketball from his Father.</h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, the </span>NBA<span data-preserver-spaces=true> player mostly stayed with his mom during his dad’s professional career. Nonetheless, he would visit him every summer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Melvin would teach his son about basketball, its rules, and a few of his moves. Consequently, he grew up loving and respecting the game.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Aside from that, the basketballer has two siblings. He has an older half-brother named <strong>Davon Wade</strong> and a younger half-sister named<a href=# rel=noopener> Mya Powell</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Devin-Booker-with-his-father-Melvin-Booker.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The brothers would play almost all sports together while their sisters cheered them on.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Mya was diagnosed with a chromosomal genetic disorder called <strong>Microdeletion</strong> <strong>syndrome</strong> when she was young.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a result, the disorder has stunted her emotional intelligence and overall growth. However, the diagnosis does not stop her from enjoying life and being a wonderful sister.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Education</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Initially, the basketballer attended high school at </span>Grandville Public School<span data-preserver-spaces=true> in Michigan. He started his high school basketball journey there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>But the athlete’s father wanted him to play at </span><strong>Moss Point School District</strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in Mississippi, where he played.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Furthermore, Melvin retired from his professional career and became an assistant basketball coach at Moss Point to be close to his son.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Likewise, he wanted Devin to develop a better work ethic and proper basketball skills.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, he persuaded <strong>Booker</strong> and <strong>Gutiérrez</strong> that he had to move to Mississippi to be today’s great basketball player.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Devin-Booker-playing-for-Kentuky.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The mother-son duo initially hesitated but eventually gave in after Booker’s freshman season.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Upon moving to his father’s alma mater, the </span>NBA<span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;player learned how to shoot better and in perfect form.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hence, even though he couldn’t grasp the importance of moving as a high schooler, he is grateful for it today.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Moreover, the athlete thanks his mother for making the strong decision to let him go.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After that, he attended the </span>University of Kentucky<span data-preserver-spaces=true>, where he played collegiate basketball for the&nbsp;</span>Kentucky Wildcats<span data-preserver-spaces=true> men’s basketball team.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Devin Booker | Age and Height&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The basketballer is 27–</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>years old as of October&nbsp;</span>30, 2023<span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides that, he is an exceptional athlete and takes great care of his body and diet.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>As a result, he is quite healthy and has a toned physique. Furthermore, the shooting guard is <strong>1.95</strong> <strong>meters</strong> </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>tall and weighs&nbsp;</span><strong>206</strong> <strong>lbs</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Booker-1.jpg><p>Talking about the other physical appearances of the basketball player, he has a black pair of eyes with black hair color.</p><p>Likewise, his faded haircut style is quite famous on social media sites.</p><p>Booker also has got a tattoo on his right forearm. The tattoo says ‘Be Legendary,’ which is a tribute to Kobe Bryant.</p><p>A few years back, Kobe gifted Booker a signed shoe with the message “<strong>Be Legendary</strong>” written on them, and Devin got the same tattoo on his body.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Devin Booker | Basketball Career</span></h2><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>High School Stats&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The NBA player started his high school basketball career with&nbsp;</span>Grandville Public School<span data-preserver-spaces=true>.
