The information they have suggests there was not a big party there that night.&nbsp;</p><p>The police tell Us they believe the man slipped into the pool overnight and was found in the morning. The identity of the body has not been released, and the police would not confirm whether or not Moore had been notified.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source tells Us Weekly that <strong>Rumer Willis</strong> is currently in New York, while her younger sisters <strong>Tallulah</strong> and <strong>Scout Willis</strong> have been Instagramming photos from France.</p><p>The story is still developing.
