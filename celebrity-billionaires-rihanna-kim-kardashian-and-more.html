Celebrities who breathe that rarefied air have usually diversified their portfolios to include all kinds of partnerships, investments and projects unrelated to their acting or music skills.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Rihanna</strong></a>, for example, <a href=#>became a billionaire in August 2021</a>, but as fans know all too well, she hasn’t released an album since January 2016. The earnings that put her over the top didn’t come from her music, but rather her Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin lines and her lucrative Savage x Fenty lingerie company.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, another musician turned billionaire, is in the same boat as Rihanna — his music makes him far less money than his numerous other ventures. In April 2020, after months of back-and-forth, Forbes magazine <a href=#>finally declared that the rapper was worth about $1.3 billion</a>, between his Yeezy holdings, real estate and other investments.</p><p>His ex-wife, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, is <a href=#>also a member of the billionaires’ club</a> thanks to her Skims shapewear and KKW Beauty line, the latter of which was undergoing a refresh as of July 2021.</p><p>Her little sister <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, however, is not in the club, despite a 2019 Forbes report that dubbed her the world’s youngest “self-made” billionaire. After further review of her assets, <a href=#>the magazine revoked the title in May 2020</a>, claiming that the Kylie Cosmetics founder’s team had provided inaccurate documents.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Life of Kylie alum wasn’t bothered by the change, though. “I thought this was a reputable site,” she tweeted at the time. “All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I’ve never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see which celebrities are members of the 10-figure club:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKa4xJupoqypYq%2BquMuipqeZmaeytHnRop%2Bapp6Weqy1zGaimqqUlsCptcCnZJqmlGK6sL7EaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-cricket-ball-types-made-of.html><span>←</span><span>What is a cricket ball made of and what are the types?</span></a>
