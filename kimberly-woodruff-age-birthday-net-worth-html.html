Apart from that, love and affection remain the same.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a> in March 2017,&nbsp;on their 28th marriage anniversary, her chart-topping hitmaker husband said: <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>I’m glad she’s stuck with me all this time and not kick me on the curb.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Cube’s comments aren’t surprising given the 50-year-old has been on her husband’s side through thick or thin: whether it was during Cube’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fallout</a> with his rap group N.W.A and everything that ensued after the group’s dismantling or his movies flopping badly in his box office or&nbsp;his declining rap career. Whatever be the problem, Ice Cube had&nbsp;Kim as the only constant in his life.</p><p>Despite having a famous husband, she prefers to keep herself out of the limelight except&nbsp;making some <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appearances</a> on events such as&nbsp;red carpets, movie premieres, and her husband’s music releases.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>If&nbsp;she wanted she could have bagged some projects for herself in the land of Hollywood as well but she opposed the idea of the limelight and thus hasn't appeared in any Hollywood projects.&nbsp;However, her job at home, taking care of their kids shouldn't be underlooked either. In fact, she has excelled at her job beyond reproach.</p><p>Besides that, while her husband was grinding out one Hollywood blockbusters after another and releasing gold-certified albums, she was ‘hands-on’ dealing with his finances. As a result of her continuous dedication at home and as a business associate, Ice Cube has amassed a net worth of $160 million, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Considering how they are married for over 25 years, she’s entitled to half his net worth, if not more. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Reengaged With Husband Ice Cube</h2><p>The romantic duo's love for each other was on display to the media when the famous rapper spilled the beans about his and Kimberley's re-engagement, after hitting the 20-year mark together. Speaking with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nova's&nbsp;Fitzy & Wippa</a> in May 2018, he revealed that he first surprised his wife with a new car on their anniversary and had a new ring left on the seats of the car, and asked her to get engaged again.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple looks perfect at their matching height of Kim being standing at the height of 5&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches as well as her husband, Ice Cube stands at the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">height</a> of 5 feet 8 inches, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C2rq7Eq6OyZaekvKW%2B1J%2BdZpmXmnqjtdGtn52ZqWK7psCMsKarrJhjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./josie-duggar-makes-ultra-rare-appearance-in-duggar-family-video.html><span>←</span><span>Josie Duggar Makes Ultra-Rare Appearance in Duggar Family Video</span></a>
