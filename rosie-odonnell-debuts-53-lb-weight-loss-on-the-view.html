After 10 minutes of chatting with fellow moviegoers, they said to her: “I hope this doesn t insult you, honey, but you look a little like that Rosie O’Donnell.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She responded, “I am Rosie O’Donnell,” stopping the women dead in their tracks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A lot of people who have never had weight issues their whole life would assume that losing weight and going from morbidly obese to being able to buy clothes off the rack would be only full of happiness and positivity, but that’s not true,” the co-host revealed. “It’s also full of anxiety and vulnerability. I’m glad it’s going at the rate it is because any faster than this would throw me into a panic.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">O’Donnell continued: “There are many issues for why people gain weight. Some gain weight as a layer of protection. To keep people away from them. I never wanted someone to want to approach me in a sexual manner because of my physical body because of child abuse issues. So I think they are all interwoven and they don’t exist separately so they come up, and I’m having to put out fires and talk to my therapist and get through it and find a different way to cope with my anxiety and my feelings of PTSD rather than eating over them.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Turns out, she’s not the only one eating differently on the show: Her co-host Whoopi Goldberg also revealed a thinner figure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve lost about 35 pounds,” Goldberg said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her method? “I’m using Rocco DiSpirito’s diet book <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Pound a Day Diet</a>,” she said. “And I feel good.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Like O’Donnell, she is in no rush to lose any more. “If I think about [losing more weight], I would start freaking out,” Goldberg said. “I’m just doing it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to their frankness about weight loss, the two veteran talk show stars, along with new co-hosts Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, spoke candidly on air about domestic violence and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>controversy surrounding Ray Rice</a>, whom the NFL suspended for apparently punching his wife, Janay Palmer Rice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I question whether or not racism plays a part in this,” O’Donnell said after the show. “I’d like to delve deeper. Can we please find some white corporate CEOs who have been charged with domestic abuse and have then been fired from their jobs and lost their jobs?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Domestic violence is a huge issue in the U.S. and it can’t be truncated into one man, Ray Rice, who is vilified, and then the story is over,” she continued. “That’s not how it works. We’re hoping to dig deep through the layers of that story and find the conflicts.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Goldberg agrees. “I don’t want to just jump on the bandwagon,” she said after the show. “I want to find out what happened. That’s what the show is for – to inform people what is going on.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for how it all went, O’Donnell was relieved. “I had tremendous nerves,” she said. “We only had one day to rehearse, which was Thursday. And that was tremendously anxiety-producing. I haven’t done it in a while, and there are new people and it’s a new show. And that really kind of threw me. But I think I know, after I got through today, it would be okay, and that’s what happened.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The View creator Barbara Walters also praised the new hosts. “They were terrific,” Walters told PEOPLE afterward. “And I’m completely unbiased.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-want-more-stories-like-this></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Want more stories like this?</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sign-up-for-our-newsletter-and-other-special-offers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sign up for our newsletter and other special offers:</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">sign me up</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-thank-you-for-signing-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Thank you for signing up!</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6SrfLO70qKcZqeUpLuvsculZJ2dkqrBtHmUbGSlml2ssqqzx61kpaejqHqwuoytn55lpp6yuHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./posh-cambridge-university-students-naked-calendar.html><span>←</span><span>Posh Cambridge University students get naked for raunchy charity calendar</span></a>
