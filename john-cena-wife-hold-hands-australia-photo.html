The two wrestlers had dated in 2012, before getting engaged in 2017, but they split up before making it down the aisle in 2018. Nikki, 39, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married her husband</a>&nbsp;<strong>Artem Chigvintsev&nbsp;</strong>in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paris during a ceremony</a> in August, but the pair’s special&nbsp;Nikki Bella Says I Do&nbsp;will air on Thursday, January 26 at 9 p.m.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>For the Australian outing, John was dressed up as they left the airport. The Peacemaker&nbsp;actor rocked a pinstriped, dark blue, three-piece suit, complete with a vest and a white shirt underneath. He completed the look with a pair of brown dress shoes. Shay was in a more comfortable outfit. She sported gray loungers and a matching crop top, as well as white sandals.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>John and Shay<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> started dating</a> in 2019, and they got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married in Vancouver</a> in October 2020. Before he started dating Nikki, John was briefly married to <strong>Elizabeth Huberdeau&nbsp;</strong>from 2009 to 2012. John has often shared how much he loves Shay when speaking about her in interviews. He had remarked that if he could switch places with one person for a day, it <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>would be his wife,</a> during a January 2022 interview on&nbsp;Ellen.&nbsp;“I often talk with my wife. I would switch places with her, and I would want her to switch places with me,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s shaping up to be a busy year for John! The actor is currently starring in the HBO series&nbsp;Peacemaker,&nbsp;which follows his&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;character after the events of the movie. Not only that, he has eight projects that are expected to come out in the coming year, including the upcoming&nbsp;WWE 2K23&nbsp;video game, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ye5FvZqOnmKN6pLHNmmSwoZaaeqm7y51koZmemcBurdSsq6uZnJ6ubrzHqKuoZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-pascall.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Brad Pascall net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
