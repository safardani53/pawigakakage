Also about Jovi and Yara’s strip club conflict)</p><p>But Tammy lunging for Kalani? If it was acting, it’s shockingly good for this show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Somehow, Tammy continuously expressed the belief that Asuelu and Kalani "owe" Lesina support.</p><p>While Tammy felt fully justified in telling Kalani how to be and what to do, that did not extend to Kalani’s family.</p><p>She acts like Kolini has no right to speak whatsoever … a weirdly inconsistent view that she has not explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Violent threats are just part of it, as we mentioned.</p><p>Tammy has also seemed to believe that Lesina is justified in pushing this intergenerational pyramid scheme onto Asuelu.</p><p>Lesina wants money from all of her children, apparently. Does Tammy give her money?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tammy’s name is Tammy Acosta.</p><p>Like the rest of the Pulaa family, she is originally from Samoa.</p><p>Tammy married a man named Erik Acosta, who has not been seen on the show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Tammy has two children: a son named Eric and a daughter named Lezyna.</p><p>Reportedly, she does have a job.</p><p>Aside from her appearances on 90 Day Fiance, however,&nbsp;what she actually does is unclear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>“I have my own little family, just like Asuelu does," Tammy told the camera after pushing for more cash for Lesina.</p><p>"I work and take care of my family here, but at the same time, I need to take of mom and my parents back home,” she added.</p><p>Bizarrely, Tammy then insisted: “He needs to help back home and make it fair.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>There is, of course, nothing "fair" about endlessly sending money to someone.</p><p>Asuelu didn’t sign up to be born — no one does.</p><p>There is no justice in his mother demanding regular payments from him because she feels entitled to it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Though Tammy does not appear to be on Instagram, she is on Facebook.</p><p>There, she has posted about how "the opinions of others" do "not matter" to her.</p><p>We suppose that this must be a comforting thought to someone who receives public backlash for her bad behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It is possible that some of Tammy’s violent antics and threats are only for the camera’s benefit.</p><p>This was implied by Kalani’s father, Low, who is also Samoan.</p><p>He noted that people sometimes modify their behavior when they are in "hand distance," earning a chuckle from viewers and from his wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>If Tammy is acting, though, she is much better than some of the less convincing members of the cast.</p><p>(Angela Deem, for example, is not a very skilled liar; her tone and facial expression are easy giveaways when she’s being dishonest)</p><p>From her appraisal of the house to her snubbing of Kalani to her aggression that evening … Tammy seems sincere.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Cultural differences are not enough to explain the malice and hostility at play here.</p><p>And frankly, though Lesina is not the only one to present Samoan traditions as a pyramid scheme, Low has explained that she’s misrepresenting things.</p><p>Sometimes, someone is a bad person and tries to hide behind claims of cultural differences. It’s a shame that Asuelu’s relatives have chosen to be this way.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2WFcMDApqSyZZGYvLTAwGauoZmkYoZxecOasGaemZa7pLGMn5inq12otbDBy51kpKafrHqirs6uq2aZo6qyrcHSZqpo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pump-rules-scheana-shay-defends-costar-amid-racist-tweet-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Pump Rules' Scheana Shay Defends Costar Amid Racist Tweet Scandal</span></a>
