DiVincenzo and Kathie DiVincenzo. According to a report from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheNetline</a>, Donte inherited his love of basketball from his father, John.</p><p>The father and son would watch basketball together religiously as Donte was growing up.</p><p>According to a report from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>, Donte's dad was a dedicated fan of the Milwaukee Bucks for decades before Donte was even born. Naturally, John was thrilled when his son was drafted for the team back in 2018.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kathie works as a real estate paralegal for the firm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hogan McDaniel</a>. Overall though, Donte's parents are relatively private, not appearing to have public social media accounts at all.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Donte DiVincenzo's ethnicity? He's got an iconic NBA nickname.</h2><p>He wasn't nicknamed "The Big Ragu" for nothing, y'all! Donte's ethnicity is Italian through and through, hence "The Big Ragu," nickname Donte wears like a badge of honor.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Back in 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS Sports</a> compiled some iconic social media reactions to Donte being drafted to the Bucks, with one Twitter user joking, "It's not delivery, it's DiVincenzo."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>DiVincenzo sounds like a delicious pizza tbh</p>— Morgan Moriarty (@Morgan_Moriarty) <a href=#>April 3, 2018</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Please allow me to be the first to cleverly put the words DONTE'S INFERNO together.</p>— Steve Greenberg (@SLGreenberg) <a href=#>April 3, 2018</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How old is Donte?</h2><p>According to Donte's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> profile, his birthday is January 31, 1997. After helping the Bucks win the NBA championship in 2021, Donte was traded from the Bucks to the Sacramento Kings in February 2022.</p><p>However, that wasn't the only team switch Donte experienced that year — he ended up on the Golden State Warriors in July 2022.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC Sports</a>, Donte had this to say about his draft experience overall: "It's kind of a unique, because I got traded two different times ... But the first time, it was kind of unexpected. I thought once we traded for Jrue Holiday, I thought everything was done. So I was kind of blindsided by that one."</p><p>However, Donte tried to see the silver lining in his drafting experience by being there for his teammates experiencing similar drafting/trading anxiety.</p><p>He said in the same report, "So to just tell these young guys, 'Listen, don't worry about anything. You get a call, you get a call. But don't let it mess with your process getting ready before the game and performing on the court.' At the end of the day, what you can control is what you do in those 48 minutes."
