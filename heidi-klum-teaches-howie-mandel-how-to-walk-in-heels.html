Walk, walk, walk walk. When you're halfway, turn, turn!" Klum coached Mandel as she snapped her fingers to keep the comedian on beat. "Come, come. And now give me a sexy pose! Sexy, sexy, do it like how I did it. Perfect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After Mandel posted the hilarious clip on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram</a> "learning from the best," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ellen DeGeneres</a> asked Klum about the comedian's high heel skills during her recent appearance on The Ellen Degeneres Show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We always goof around. There's so much time always in between [filming]. Or we go on a dinner break and they set up the stage again," Klum explained when DeGeneres asked what inspired Mandel to start modeling the star's footwear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Klum continued: "He's always making fun of me, like how hard can it be? And I'm like, really? Let's see. And I have a foot [size] 11 so he, sure enough, fit in my shoes. That's the outcome. He's always up for anything. Honestly, I love him so much."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model also opened up about what it's been like to be back on the AGT set with the whole crew of judges (including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Simon Cowell</a>, who grappled with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>back injury</a> last year) and a live audience. "It is amazing. Finally Simon is back because last year we had to do it without him. He was so jealous," Klum said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mandel recently told PEOPLE</a> that a key component to returning to AGT is the live audience, which was scrapped last March due to the onset of the pandemic.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was wonderful — it's like you've been lost forever, and now you feel like, 'I'm home,'" Mandel said of taping auditions in Pasadena, California, with a limited audience. "Just to hear a reaction behind you, just to hear anybody be behind you and, kind of, affirm that what you just heard or what you just saw or how you just judged — they're either in agreement with [you], or they're totally opposed to what you just said."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added: "It feels like we're alive again, we're alive and it's real. It's the fuel that they need to keep going."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqGcopyZYritwcxmq56Zk52ytHnHqK6inV2irq%2BwxKVkoaenYsGwedaao6RlmaN6qbHEpapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dixie-damelio.html><span>←</span><span>Dixie DAmelio Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
