Canadian businessman <strong>Jas Mathur</strong> and UFC star <strong>Georges St-Pierre, both whom are from Montreal, </strong>were spotted together earlier this week, leading to speculation that the Canadian expansion for Limitless is on the horizon.</p><p>The Limitless Performance founder and CEO posted an <a href=#>Instagram</a> photo with the mixed martial artist, 39, on Tuesday, March 30. “Work Harder Than You Did Yesterday & Never Give Up!!!” he captioned the pic, adding muscle and sunglasses emojis. “#Summer2021 #Limitless.”</p><p>They were also seen at popular Italian restaurant Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, March 31.</p><p>Mathur and St-Pierre’s hangouts caused some to assume they are teaming up for a business venture. After all, the entrepreneur’s brand Limitless has partnered with high-end talent like the Canada native in the past and they are both health and fitness enthusiasts.</p><p>While St-Pierre is currently starring in <a href=#>Disney+’s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a>, his next venture might involve expanding the outreach of his brand. The professional fighter first appeared as mercenary Georges Batroc in 2014’s Captain America: The Winter Soldier. He reprised the role in the series premiere of the spinoff series, which premiered in March.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Entrepreneur-Jas-Mathur-UFC-Georges-St-Pierre-Spark-Partnership-Rumors-1.jpg><p>St-Pierre declined to confirm whether he would appear in any of the show’s future installments. “I can’t say anything about the next episodes,” he told <a href=#>TV Insider</a> in March. “It’s amazing, though — I’ve always been a big fan of <a href=#>Marvel superheroes</a>. For me, it’s a dream come true. It’s like someone who plays basketball having a chance to play in the NBA.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Mathur, for his part, <a href=#>launched a new CBD product line called SMILZ</a> with <a href=#><strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong></a> in March. The duo worked alongside a team of scientists and farmers to make sure the products included proprietary blends of fast-acting hemp CBD and high-quality botanical terpenes. “At any time, you can check the lab results from third-party tests on the website,” Mathur said. “We want our customers to feel comfortable, safe and satisfied the whole way — from the moment they confirm their purchase to the last drop they take from their bottle.”</p><p>Mathur reflected on his business via <a href=#>Instagram</a> in March, writing: “10+ years of chasing a dream, countless sleepless nights, blocking out all the negativity, extreme laser-focus, believing in MYSELF and being PATIENT is what it took to create this beast of a brand house called #LIMITLESS.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmaNiuqLAx66pZp%2BVpL%2BosdJmqq1loJ6ys77EZqqpmaKgerGt0a2lnqqjnbaxedGupKiqo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./m-madan-babu.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | M.
