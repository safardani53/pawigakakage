All about working in TV. From when I started doing bit parts in Coronation Street right up to Car Share.</p><p>"It's been a real joy recalling the memories. There's over 20 years of stories about filming series like Phoenix Nights and Max & Paddy's Road To Nowhere.</p><p>"Appearing on chat shows like Parkinson, at the Queen's Golden Jubilee and sharing letters from Ronnie Barker. We wrote to each other for years as pen pals until he passed away."</p><p>He added: "I'm very proud of it. I'll no doubt be recording that book too before you know it. I just hope people enjoy it as much as this first one."</p><p>Peter&nbsp; has been largely out of the spotlight in recent years but returned to the stage in August for two special charity events to raise money for Laura Nuttall, 20, who has an aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.</p><p>He cancelled his last tour in December 2017, citing "unforeseen family circumstances".</p><p>Peter’s first autobiography still holds the record for the biggest selling British hardback autobiography of all time, selling more than two million copies worldwide.</p><p>He recorded the first chapter of the book at the time it was published in 2006 and released it for charity but never got round to recording the rest - until lockdown when he got to work at home.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Peter released his second book, Saturday Night Peter, in 2009, when it was also a bestseller.</p><p>Addressing why he had never written before, he said: "I suppose life gets in the way. Becoming a dad changed my priorities.</p><p>"The trick is getting the balance right in your life. I think a lot of people were forced to realise that during the pandemic.</p><p>"I think a lot of people's priorities will have changed forever now. Hopefully for the better."</p><p>The Sound Of Laughter will be available on Audible from September 16.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/NINTCHDBPICT000552344230.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Peter Kay on stage for the first time in years as he dazzles fans in Manchester</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2taGlmZYV3fZVxZqmdpJq%2FbrfAsmSnnadirrbAzpugqJ%2Bilr2pxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lorenzo-neal.html><span>←</span><span>Lorenzo Neal</span></a>
