We’d never dream of it.</p><p>But this is exactly what Catelynn’s own brother believes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lowell’s half-sibling, River, who shares a dad with the popular reality star, jumped on Instagram this week in the wake of Catelynn confirming her latest pregnancy …</p><p>… and went all scorched-earth on Lowell.</p><p>"Lol my sister got pregnant AGAIN to try and stay relevant," wrote River, making quite the accusation against Catelynn in the process.</p><p>Wow. Just wow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>As you can see, Catelynn’s younger brother Nick chimed in with a grammatically challenged but nonetheless strong response to River’s uncalled-for message, taking him to task over it.</p><p>Girl please. Incredible.</p><p>For whatever it’s worth, River is paralyzed and wheelchair bound and is the product of a relationship Catelynn’s father had after he split from Catelynn’s mother when their daughter was three.</p><p>River rarely speaks out about his half-sister, which is what makes this statement even more glaring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Could there be any validity to his claim?</p><p>We have no idea. In fact, it sounds ridiculous, we strongly doubt it and are not supporting it in any way by printing it here.</p><p>Catelynn and Tyler welcomed a daughter named Carly when they were teenagers, giving her up for adoption at the time.</p><p>They are now parents to daughters Novalee Baltierra, 6, and Vaeda Baltierra, 2, and soon, <a href=#>another baby girl</a> sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"This rainbow was worth the storm,” Catelynn wrote via Instagram two days ago, referencing the heartbreaking miscarriage she suffered in 2020 and adding with excitement:</p><p>“Baby Baltierra coming soon.”</p><p>Lowell then confirmed that she’s expecting a girl. Obviously, they know there’s interest in their lives and don’t shy away from sharing such news. But doing it for attention?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Cate and her husband have talked for years about wanting a big family.</p><p>They’re not perfect people (none of us are), but they have always come across like the most loving parents imaginable on air and/or on social media.</p><p>Hence why it’s nearly impossible to give any credence to River’s theory, that Catelynn only gets knocked up for the attention she receives as a result.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In any case, Catelynn said she’s 13 weeks along and was shocked she got pregnant so quickly after losing her previous baby.</p><p>"I was definitely surprised that we got pregnant so fast with this baby! But we are so excited," Lowell told the <a href=#>celebrity gossip</a> site Celebuzz, which apparently is still a thing.</p><p>The Teen Mom OG star also said that when she first told Tyler about it, he didn’t believe her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I just handed him the positive test,” Catelynn explaiined, adding that Tyler still didn’t accept the news until Catelynn “missed [her] period and took another test that was positive.”</p><p>River’s gross comment against his sister is all the more appalling because Catelynn opened up in December about her tragic miscarriage.</p><p>“I am sharing this to let you know you are not alone," she wrote back then.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Lowell added:</p><p>“We are all in this together and everyone experiences pain, loss, and the recovery from it.</p><p>"I am still in the thick of dealing with this loss as it was recent and all the emotional trauma that follows such a loss in an already horrifically hard year.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Here’s hoping the baby joy she and Tyler are experiencing won’t be lessened at all by the online critiques of others, whether it’s family or the media.</p><p>The Baltierras have a beautiful family that is about to grow once more, and no one can take that away from them.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2tpX2V%2FcK%2FArZylsZ6jeq271p6jpWWSp7y1tMSrZK2gmaO4tHnSoZxmn5%2Bpeqy6zpyinpxdqr1uttSsq2asn2K0psCMmqto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbara-dickson-19470927-html.html><span>←</span><span>Barbara Dickson (Pop Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
