It’s 55.</p><p>So ex-Volkswagen design guru Oliver Stefani has been charged with lowering this while maintaining all the unerring practicality, roominess and value which makes up <a href=#>Skoda</a>’s DNA.</p><p>Straight off the bat, this Fabia looks much fab-ier.</p><p>Longer and wider than before, the sharp crease lines linking the proud new BMW 1 Series-esque grille to the trendy split-LED rear tail lamps, sculpted bonnet and roof spoiler definitely do the trick for starters.</p><p>In fact, its new stretched wheel-base is longer than the original Skoda Octavia — the Fabia’s big brother.</p><p>And capping off the repackaged success, there is greater headroom in the back and 50 litres more boot space, which brings it to 380 litres — the same as a VW Golf.</p><p>The Fabia cabin takes its lead from the newly launched Enyaq, with a big, free-standing infotainment touchscreen set into a contemporary, swoopy fabric-covered dashboard.</p><p>The binnacle is cool too, with bold cutaways featuring the Fabia name — something not previously shouted about at all.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>And inside it nests an optional digital cockpit display like you’d find in an expensive Audi.</p><p>I say optional, but you’d be daft not to have it for a few extra quid a month.</p><p>Honestly, Mr Stefani and his 100-strong design team from 25 countries have pulled it out of the bag here.</p><p>But what’s it like to drive?</p><p>Well, it’s a little less successful in that department.</p><p>From launch there are four petrol engines to pick from but they’re all very sensible one-litre, three-cylindered ones. And they range from 65hp to 110hp, with only the turbocharged top one offering the option of a seven-speed auto.</p><p>That said, the five-speed manual is more of a natural fit for these low-powered engines at urban speeds but there’s a lack of grunt that can prove noticeably tedious at times when you want to press on.</p><h2>Frugal fighting form</h2><p>The benefit of this, of course, is fuel economy, with all the engines returning nearly 50mpg.</p><p>The ride is on the softer side, and composed for the most part, while the direct steering leaves nothing to complain about for a runabout. Early next year there will be the further option of a 1.5-litre 150hp petrol, which should be more fun to drive — although exclusively available as an auto.</p><p>So no hybrid or electric options to be had?&nbsp;</p><p>Nope. Not happening. And for good reason. Skoda is insistent on keeping the Fabia excellent value for money, and this is how they’re doing it, by not over-developing and not needing to pass that expense on to the buyer.</p><p>Or being Simply Clever — as they like to say. Which brings me neatly on to the little touches Skoda toss in to make your life just a tad easier. These include a windscreen ticket clip, removable and adjustable easy-open cup-holders, umbrellas in the doors, a bonus USB-C port in the rear-view mirror for tidy dashcam power, and wireless charging.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Tech’d up with larger car treats including a heated steering wheel and windscreen, adaptive cruise control and park assist, the Fabia is in frugal fighting form to strengthen its position in the supermini league.</p><p>It’s a simple and comfortable case of price, practicality and presentation over performance and you don’t need to be 55 to be down with that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000674147385.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000674147356.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">KEY FACTS: SKODA FABIA</h3></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> £15,000 (est.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Engine:</strong> 1-litre petrol turbocharged&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Power:</strong> 95hp, 175Nm</p><p><strong>0-62mph:</strong> 10.6 secs</p><p><strong>Top speed: </strong>121mph&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Economy: </strong>48mpg&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CO2:</strong> 126g/km</p><p><strong>Out: </strong>November</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Skoda's glowing electric Vision iV concept is a fantasy set to come true in 2021</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqamraeiqHxygZhrcG1oYmS7psOMrKKonJFis6KuyJpkpqeimnq0vMCcnGaZnpl6tbHCoWSsmZ2aerety66caA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-bradley.html><span>←</span><span>John Bradley- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
