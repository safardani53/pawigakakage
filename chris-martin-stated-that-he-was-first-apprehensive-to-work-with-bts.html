Martin noted that when someone recommended that the British rock band cooperate with BTS, he was first hesitant due to the septet‚Äôs dissimilar culture and language:</p><p>‚ÄúAt first, I was judgmental, as is typically my initial response since I am human.‚Äù</p><p>He revealed this during the band‚Äôs 2022-2023 Music of the Spheres World Tour performance of The Astronaut with BTS Jin in Argentina. Today, though, he considers himself fortunate as an artist and as Coldplay‚Äôs vocalist that they made the essential choice to collaborate with BTS.</p><h2>BTS followers applaud Chris Martin‚Äôs candor and express their own emotions.</h2><p>While presenting Jin on stage, Chris Martin said that he was originally hesitant to collaborate with the K-pop titans, admitting that the band had closed-minded attitudes and that the fear of cooperating with musicians outside their culture was unknown ground for them.&nbsp;He overcame his biases, though, and accepted a chance to collaborate with BTS on the deep and relaxing My Universe tune, which was released last year.&nbsp;Not only was the song a huge hit on the music charts, but the worldwide boy groups became friends as a result of their cooperation, and it has been a joyful and rewarding working relationship for both sides.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chris-Martin.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Chris Martin shared what he discovered throughout the process:</p><p>‚ÄúRather than being afraid of the other, embrace it.‚Äù</p><p>BTS fans praised Chris Martin for his open and honest admission about working with the K-pop septet. ARMYs also loved how he realized he was mistaken in harboring this bias and how glad and delighted they were to work and be friends with BTS.&nbsp;During the quarantine, Chris Martin flew to South Korea to finish the recording for My Universe with the Bangtan band and also learned some Korean to add those lines to the song.</p><p>ARMYs applaud Chris Martin for maintaining a genuine working connection with the members of BTS rather than utilizing them for clout and exposure, as many western musicians have done in the past.&nbsp;Certain ARMYs even admitted to having earlier biases towards the Bangtan members and how they overcame them to become lifetime admirers of the septet. Coldplay did not hesitate when Jin contacted Chris Martin six months ago, seeking the best goodbye song dedicated to ARMYs before joining the military, and My Universe was extremely well-received by fans all over the globe.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>the way chris martin introduced seokjin, bts, and The Astronaut ü•∫ <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/p6p1Fm2VGB</a></p><p>‚Äî lex‚Å∑ (@prodK0YA) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 29, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Chris Martin introducing Wootteo from <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#Jin</a> to the crowd at show 5 of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#ColdplayBuenosAires</a></p><p>I‚Äôm voting for BTS (<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">@BTS_twt</a>) for Favorite Pop Duo or Group at the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#AMAs</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qQZEGzuYqC</a></p><p>‚Äî ColdplayXtra (@coldplayxtra) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">November 2, 2022</a></p><p>The Astronaut is a present to Jin, co-written by the Bangtan singer and Coldplay‚Äôs vocalist Chris Martin, who also provided backup vocals with son Moses Martin, with the rest of the band supplying instrumentation.&nbsp;Not only have the two boy bands become friends, but Chris Martin has gone out of his way on multiple occasions to praise and protect Bangtan members, solidifying their lifetime bond.</p><h2>Behind the scenes of their latest cooperation, Chris Martin and BTS Jin demonstrated their dance abilities.</h2><p>ARMYs found Chris Martin‚Äôs love and admiration for Jin wonderful as they recently took center stage at Coldplay‚Äôs Argentina performance, singing The Astronaut for the first time in front of a live crowd. Fans praised the beautiful rapport and camaraderie that the Bangtan members formed with Coldplay, particularly after seeing a behind-the-scenes video of Chris Martin slow dancing with Jin during preparations. Jin can be seen approaching Chris Martin and giving him a big embrace. Chris Martin, on the other hand, converted it into a mini-waltz session, to which Jin danced.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Chris-Martin-2.jpg alt="Chris Martin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jin and Coldplay gave a fantastic live rendition of The Astronaut, drawing acclaim and praise from fans all around the globe.
