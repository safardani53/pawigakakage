According to Celebrity Net Worth, the reality star is worth $5 million. However, there are conflicting figures, with Reality TitBit reporting her net worth as $50 million.</p><p>The RHONJ star is well-known for her lavish house renovations, which she completes with the help of her contractor husband. Season 13 of RHONJ will see the ladies’ hostilities rise as the Giudice-Gorga family rivalry resurface. This season’s subject will be family turmoil, relationship troubles, broken friendships, and new beginnings.</p><p>The official summary of the program is as follows:</p><p>“After a rocky year that tested loyalties and sparked feuds, the women of the Garden State are discovering that you reap what you sow when it comes to sowing seeds. Marriages, friendships, and families have been tested, but will 2022 be the year to finally mend what has been broken?”</p><p>The 13th season of RHONJ is set to debut with shortened 75-minute episodes on Bravo on Tuesday, February 7, 2023, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Meet Margaret Josephs, a well-known designer, and RHONJ TV personality.</h2><p>55-year-old Margaret Josephs, an RHONJ reality star, is a well-known fashion designer, TV lifestyle expert, and entrepreneur. She was born on April 9, 1967, in the United States of America, in the town of Elizabeth, New Jersey. She is the daughter of the previous glam doll Margaret Sr. Margaret Josephs worked as a dress designer at New York Garment Center after graduating from FIT with a degree in marketing and fashion design. Josephs had a successful company before Bravo fans were acquainted with her on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. The bulk of Josephs’ revenue comes from her clothing and accessories company, Macbeth Collection, which she founded in 1999.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Margaret-Josephs-2.jpg alt="Margaret Josephs" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Margaret Josephs’ designer line is available on her website, MargaretJosephs.com, where she offers a range of things embellished with colorful patterns and colors.&nbsp;The Macbeth Collection ships its items worldwide and provides a wide range of cosmetics, bags, luggage, home goods, and office supplies. The brand has been likened to Nine West, Kate Spade, Guess, and Coach. Margaret has created her own line of non-alcoholic mocktails, Soirée, in collaboration with creative director Lexi.</p><p>The RHONJ star is renowned for her tagline “Caviar Dreams, Tuna Fish Budget,” and she has a book and podcast with the same title. She also aggressively promotes her Caviar Dreams company.&nbsp;Margaret was selected Country Living Entrepreneur of the Year in 2007. In 2008, she was also named an Honorary Judge on the County Living Entrepreneur panel.&nbsp;The Real Housewives of New Jersey star is married to Joe Benigno, and the couple lives in Englewood, New Jersey. Jan Josephs, her first husband, died in 2013. Joe is her second spouse. She and Joe live in a 116-year-old home that is currently being renovated.</p><p>In an interview with Bravo TV, she commented on the restoration:</p><p>“This is a restoration rather than a makeover. Updating a 116-year-old home is not the same as constructing a new one. This is not a refurbishment for the faint of heart.”</p><p>Margaret takes great satisfaction in being involved in her community. She is a staunch LGBTQ+ ally who has hoisted the Englewood pride flag for the fourth year in a row. Margaret Josephs made her Real Housewives of New Jersey debut in the ninth season in 2017.&nbsp;She has also been on Strahan & Sara, Wendy: The Wendy Williams Show, Celebrity Page, and Watch What Happens: Life.</p><h2>Margaret Joseph will appear in RHONJ season 13 against Teresa Giudice.</h2><p>Teresa Giudice and Margaret Josephs were subjected to a great deal of stress and passion throughout Season 12 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, particularly at the reunion. During the Season 12 reunion, the two ladies clashed and exchanged words on a range of topics, including Teresa’s now-husband, Luis “Louie” Ruelas.</p><p>Teresa stated to her therapist in a season 12 episode:</p><p>“I didn’t like that I was lashing out the last time I saw her. I know Louie is incredibly forgiving, and I’ve always had trouble forgiving others. ‘We can do something about it,’ says Louie. I’ve learned that you don’t have to respond by shouting or throwing things. That is not acceptable.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Margaret-Josephs.jpg alt="Margaret Josephs" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to a Bravo TV press release, Margaret Josephs is not just dealing with problems in her relationship with Teresa this season. There will be more conflict:</p><p>“Though Margaret felt she had turned a fresh page with Jennifer after last year, she soon discovers that the mother of five, like Teresa, has been chatting to her ex-best friend. As a consequence, Margaret goes on the defensive in order to resist the growing rumors.”</p><p>RHONJ season 13 will include prominent spouses, original housewives, renowned faces, and newcomers.&nbsp;Along with newcomers Jennifer Fessler, Danielle Cabral, and Rachel Fuda, the season will also star Teresa Giudice, Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, Melissa Gorga, and Margaret Josephs.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqXlr%2BmwIyjpqydoJ3AbrXSZqqerF2pvG62zqKlZqyYmnqkrdKtZKieXaeyoriMoaauq5Wstrex0mamn2WemsRutsSrqp6xXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celebrities-over-50-who-posed-nude.html><span>←</span><span>Celebs Over 50 Who Have Posed Nude</span></a>
