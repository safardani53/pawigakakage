Food you eat in the morning, or a healthy meal to start your day right? Cereal, toast and a full English are all classed as breakfast foods, but not all of them are healthy options.</p><p>It's currently being heavily disputed as a hot debate broke out online when a wife user said her husband had wrongfully "chided" her for eating a Kellogg's Rice Krispies Squares bar for breakfast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000449394594.jpg><p>The Rice Krispie Squares are made of Rice Kispie pieces, marshmallow, and a lot of sugar, but does this mean they count at breakfast food or not?</p><p>The <a href=#>Reddit</a> user known as PickleHarry posted an image of a Rice Krispie Squares bar and wrote: "My husband (not a UK native) just chided me for having a ‘treat’ for breakfast. Surely this falls under the umbrella of cereal bars?"</p><p>The debate that followed had some hilarious responses, with a number of theories attempting to answer the eternal question: what is breakfast?</p><p>It kicks off with that-there stating the bar is an "incredibly sugary snack" - implying that it shouldn't come under the "umbrella of cereal bars".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak1.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Experiment shows we should be eating cereal from a square bowl</span><p>Findesiluer agrees, but GosephJoebbels chimes in with the nutritional facts: a Rice Krispies Squares bar has 115 calories and nine grams of sugar, which they claim to be a small amount.</p><p>While the following commenters argue it is in fact a lot of sugar, other Reddit users were commenting below with different schools of thought.</p><p>Mechanical-slug and 9DAN2 argued over whether the snack counts as a cereal bar or a 'treat' based on the amount of cereal - a certified breakfast food - the Squares contain.</p><p>The pair end up deep into a debate similar to that surrounding Jaffa Cakes, due to the use of 'cake' in the naming of some foods made with cereal - which in 9DAN2's opinion disqualifies it from being a breakfast food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/JH-MUZZ-TWEET1.jpg><p>BangaiBanagi then denounces all other points as they state: "Who gives a s**t about the semantics of what it is, the important thing is when you eat it. I had a full pack of Club biscuits for breakfast the other day, and it was breakfast not a treat since it was the first thing I ate that day."</p><p>And the argument that 'if it's the first thing you eat that day, it's breakfast' continued from here, but not before the cake-or-cereal-bar debate could continue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak3.jpg><p>Teh_yak even admits to being so confused about something being called a cake that he "once did try some soap because I'm sure it had real bits of strawberry in," admitting: "It was good for the first second or so."</p><p>The conclusion they came to was that if a bar contains 51 per cent cereal, it can be classed as a cereal bar and is therefore deemed to be a suitable food to be consumed at breakfast time.</p><p>So then the question arose again: does the Kellogg's Rice Krispies Squares bar count?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak4-e1542207617537.jpg><p>The answer appears to be 'no', according to NibblyPig, who states "it's more of a sugar-bar".</p><p>Then, the PickleHarry, the original poster, comes back to confirm what she ate as her full breakfast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak5.jpg><p>While -brownsherlock- seemed to think the addition of fruit to PickleHarry's breakfast put her "on a diet", the others chided her once more for consuming even more sugar and adding acid to the mix.</p><p>Next the debate moved onto what counts as "traditional breakfast material", arguing that regardless of sugar content, certain foods are acceptable and others aren't.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak6-e1542208256847.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak92.jpg><p>Another American breakfast food Pop Tarts are compared to our habits in the UK and bobmanuk seems to think it's okay to have a "more sugar to get started" in the morning.</p><p>But as a conclusive argument, DannyOUFC states: "It says Kellogg’s in the corner. It’s breakfast to me!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redditbreak9.1.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>This Reddit user trusts the British cereal brand name and therefore recognises the bar as a breakfast food.</p><p>This isn't the first time food debate has taken over Reddit - back in August <a href=#>another married couple landed themselves in the middle of a custard discussion</a>.</p><p>One drenched their crumble in custard and the other used just a drop, but it seemed to reignite the never-ending conversations about the correct way to eat food.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
