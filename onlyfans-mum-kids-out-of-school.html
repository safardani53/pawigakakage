No friends, family or anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>"It was a sexy secret between me and my husband that was so exciting and fun.”&nbsp;</p><p>But things took a dark turn in July 2020 when neighbours and parents from the couple's children’s school found Tiffany’s OnlyFans.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637174248-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-19-at-16.09.03.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637174215.jpg><p>The mum claims they called her names and even printed out some of her photos and emailed them to the principal.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “Someone came across my account and suddenly I had mums from school texting me and leaving voicemails saying I had to leave the school.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some women from my area actually printed out pictures I posted on my OnlyFans and mailed them to the principal of my children’s school.&nbsp;</p><p>“We were called a load of names; apparently it was 'disturbing, disgusting, horrifying' and 'my children should be kicked out!'”&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately for the couple, the school principal reportedly chose not to get involved at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Tiffany claims she was removed as the 2nd grade ‘room mother’ due to the complaints.&nbsp;</p><p>She said: “I was taken aback by this, as the implications are offensive as much as they are ironic, and it does make me sad.”&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tiffany, it wasn’t just the children’s education that the mums tried to hinder.&nbsp;</p><p>They reportedly also wrote to the local priest and bishop, as well as made a secret Facebook group to gossip about the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiffany said: “It hit me in the gut every time I heard something new.&nbsp;</p><p>In the very beginning, I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown. “It was just so intrusive, it was something that was supposed to be a secret in our marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>“They think I must be having sex with all these men and I’m not! It’s just a hot sexy wife fantasy.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637175598-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637175666.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000637175582.jpg><p>Despite the recent experience, the couple continue to work on Tiffany's OnlyFans and their children still attend the school.</p><p>Tiffany and Chris also claim there is a dedicated group “harassing them” for “no good reason”.</p><p>They believe this is due to “boredom” and “jealousy” from “wannabe famous” individuals.</p><p>Chris added: "There are certain people who just won’t leave us alone but 99% of people who find out really don’t care at all.</p><p>“A lot of people we know just say: you do you guys.</p><p>“I reckon most of the husbands have taken a look at Tiffany’s account.</p><p>"If I had heard about a school mum doing&nbsp;OnlyFans, I definitely would have!</p><p>“Maybe that’s why these women have such an issue with us.”</p><p>Chris helps his wife take pictures when the kids are busy or asleep and Tiffany answers messages from fans early in the morning.</p><p>He said: "The routine is really simple – I’ll prep 10-12 pics at some point, and she’ll upload them in the morning with her captions and schedule them to drop each hour throughout the day.</p><p>"She’ll mix in prepared sexy pics (like a lingerie shoot) with what she’s doing at the moment.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in News</h2></p><p>"And she does an 'after work' video of undressing from work clothes and summarising what happened that day – which is probably consistently the most popular thing she does.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"She’ll answer messages all day as there are a lot and you can’t let them pile up or it gets crazy.</p><p>"It’s not too hard even with the kids, although sometimes the screaming and fighting can be heard on an end-of-day video and she has to re-do it, or I have to crop the sound!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoFyfJFrbGpnn6O5urLAp6pmpaWieqy1w6xkqK2kYrynedKcn6innGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./flat-rent-north-london-sleepless-nights.html><span>←</span><span>Flat to rent for almost 1,000 a month in North London but there's a problem that might give you sl</span></a>
