According to the Associated Press, the court documents stated that neither actor would receive spousal support and that they would share joint custody of their sons, Archibald, 7, and Abel, 6. Poehler ended her two-year relationship with fellow comedian <b>Nick Kroll</b> in September 2015.</p><p>"Getting a divorce really sucks," Poehler wrote in her 2014 memoir, <i>Yes Please</i>. "Imagine spreading everything you care about on a blanket and then tossing the whole thing up in the air. The process of divorce is about loading that blanket, throwing it up, watching it all spin and worrying what stuff will break when it lands."</p><p>As for how Arnett dealt with the split? "If going to the gym obsessively for eight, nine months was my way of dealing, then let that be my worst problem," he told <i>Details</i> magazine in June 2013. "Life is challenging, and I'd say that there's no guidebook."</p><p>He added:&nbsp;“I've found my happiness — which is my kids."</p><p><span>Arnett voices the main character in <i>BoJack Horseman,</i> streaming now on Netflix. &nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoZyheqK%2BzZ6rrWWZqHqlrdOipaBlmaPBpr7IqKlmnJWotqi6xKtknqSZr66jsdOhZKWZp2LEdYCPaW9uZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./newbury-racecard-results-tv-schedule-todays-tips-runners-live-on-itv.html><span>←</span><span>Newbury racecard, results and TV schedule: Todays tips, runners, results and stats for the meetin</span></a>
