Because the case has already proceeded to judgment on both the dissolution of status and other issues, the Court declines to dismiss the action."</p><p>Tuesday's court hearing acknowledged that Lockwood now has 'de facto' full custody of his daughters, 14-year-old Harper and Finley, judicial assistant Gus Morales told DailyMail.com.</p><p>He will continue to have custody of the girls unless another family member disputes under the probate court's ongoing case.</p><p>Presley tied the knot with Lockwood - her fourth husband - in 2006, but the late star filed for divorce in 2016.</p><p><a href=#>Elvis</a>'s only daughter&nbsp;<a href=#>died on January 12</a>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<a href=#>suffering from cardiac arrest</a> at her home in Calabasas, California.</p><p>Lockwood, 61, reportedly has a good chance of keeping the girls, who have made it clear that they want to live full-time with their father, sources previously told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a>.</p><p>They have been living with the musician and his new wife, celebrity hairstylist Stephanie Hobgood, since&nbsp;<a href=#>Presley's death</a>.</p><h2>CUSTODY RUMORS</h2><p>There were previously rumors that&nbsp;<a href=#>Danny Keough</a>, her second husband, might want custody.</p><p>He moved into&nbsp;<a href=#>the family home</a>&nbsp;over two years ago following the tragic death of <a href=#>their son, Benjamin</a>, who took his own life.</p><p>However, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>California</a>&nbsp;law, Keough wouldn't be in the position to get custody, although he may try and fight for it in court.</p><p>Court documents previously showed Lockwood's lawyer,&nbsp;<a href=#>Joseph Yanny</a>, asked for a case management conference, requesting it to be filed under seal, which was granted by a judge.</p><p>Lockwood already had joint custody of the twins with Presley following a years-long battle which he claimed in court filings has&nbsp;<a href=#>left him facing bankruptcy</a>.</p><p>"It'll be a cold day in hell before he gives up custody of those children," a source connected to Lockwood told TMZ.</p><p>He revealed in other court documents that he had been "left in the dark" over his ex's estate, as his lawyer filed a "notice of the death of a party."</p><p>He claimed they have no idea who will be distributing assets to beneficiaries and who the Trustees of the estate are, according to the filing.</p><p>New court documents filed last week by Lockwood in <a href=#>Los Angeles</a> County Superior Court show he should be appointed as the guardian to represent his daughters in an upcoming hearing in probate court.</p><h2>ESTATE BATTLE</h2><p>It is scheduled to take place on April 13 and counsel for the girls filed a declaration in support of their father's petition.</p><p>Lockwood declared in the filing that he wants to officially be appointed as the twins' guardian ad litem because "the minor is a beneficiary of a trust at issue before the probate court in the above-referenced case. The minor requires [the] appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent her interests in the proceeding."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>The papers add: "There is no conflict regarding appointment because the proposed guardian is not a beneficiary of the trust instrument at issue."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>Lockwood's daughters signed consent forms to him being their guardian ad litem, according to the court documents.</p><p>An insider said the father-of-two moved into a modest three-bed, two-bath property roughly 38 miles from Calabasas in Monterey Park, worth around $800k last year, which is believed to be rented.&nbsp;</p><p>Lockwood and his wife have also been caring for his elderly mother, Vivian, who lives with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, his former mother-in-law&nbsp;<a href=#>Priscilla</a>, 77, has filed legal documents disputing who oversees the&nbsp;estate&nbsp;of her&nbsp;<a href=#>late daughter</a>, after they spent the best part of a decade estranged.</p><p>A&nbsp;Los Angeles&nbsp;filing last week disputes the validity of a 2016 amendment to her living trust that removed her mom and a former business manager and replaced them with the late singer's two oldest children, Riley and <a href=#>late Benjamin</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The US Sun</h2></p><p>Presley's documents say there are a number of issues that bring the trust amendment's authenticity into doubt, including the fact that she wasn't notified of the change.</p><p>Sources tell The U.S. Sun that Priscilla and Lockwood remain close, while she is currently not on speaking terms with granddaughter Riley Keough, 33.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/57db625c-737a-4c87-a0b2-ee8e4d653b86.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/lisa-marie-presley-second-right-788116504.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZmiAdIGYaKOiq5FiuqK%2ByJ5kqaqVqLmmxYymoJygkZq5brjOnKKwp5%2BZeqTB0q2mnbFdl661wMueZJ2ho6K2tL%2FApWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-wore-5600-balenciaga-coat-pink-sports-bra-sweats.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Wore $5600 Balenciaga Coat, Pink Sports Bra, Sweats</span></a>
