The charges include one felony count of driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage causing injury, one felony count of driving with a .08 percent blood alcohol content causing injury and one misdemeanor count of hit and run driving resulting in property damage.</p><p>Pullos pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday, July 27.</p><p>The charges stem from an April 29 accident where Pullos allegedly drove her car the wrong way on a Pasadena highway and collided head-on with another vehicle that was traveling at about 60 miles per hour. <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported at the time that police said Pullos was involved in a separate hit-and-run traffic collision before the crash on the freeway.</p><p>“Pasadena Fire units responded to a traffic collision requiring rescue at the 134 Freeway/Orange Grove exit early this morning,” the Pasadena Fire Department wrote via Facebook at the time. “Arriving units found two vehicles involved, with one person trapped, after a reported head-on collision. Fire personnel extricated one person from a vehicle and provided patient care and hospital transport for the occupants of both vehicles.”</p><p>The post concluded: “Cause is unknown but always a reminder to stay within the speed limit, avoid drinking and driving and never be distracted by passengers, phones, etc.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/General-Hospital-Star-Haley-Pullos-Charged-With-Felony-DUI-After-Near-Fatal-Crash-01.jpg><p>Earlier this month, <strong>Courtney Wilder</strong> — the driver of the other vehicle — filed a lawsuit against Pullos, according to <a href=#>TMZ</a>. In his court filing, Wilder said he was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in critical condition. He also claimed that his car was totaled in the accident.</p><p>Pullos has played Molly Lansing-Davis on General Hospital since 2009. In May, she announced that she was taking a temporary leave of absence from the show following the accident.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I was involved in an automobile accident and I’m doing OK, but I am going to need a little time to recover,” Pullos told Soap Opera Digest in a statement at the time. “I will be back as soon as possible!”</p><p>In the meantime, Animal Kingdom alum <strong>Holiday Mia Kriegel</strong> has been filling in for Pullos as Molly, making her debut in the May 22 episode of the long-running series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagnZ6av6K4jKGmrKiZqa6tv4yhmKWdqWK9trjLqKpmm5iWv6ixw2auoqyYYrOmuM6nsGacpZ58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./robert-amsterdam.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Robert Amsterdam net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
