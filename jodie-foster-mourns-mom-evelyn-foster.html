The “entertainment savy” former big band singer also worked as a publicist for Arthur Jacobs for a time, whose clients included Grace Kelly, Gregory Peck, James Stewart and Marilyn Monroe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the family’s full obituary, which asks that well-wishers “look up at the sky, open your arms and say her name” in lieu of flowers. “She would get a kick out of that,” they wrote.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Evelyn Foster.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evelyn ‘Brandy’ Foster, mother of Jodie, Lucinda, Constance and Bud, passed away peacefully in her home on May 13th from complications related to dementia. She was 90 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was raised in Rockford, Illinois but in the forties took her big band singing chops on the road to California. There she met Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Lucius Foster at a fencing match. They married and had four children together. Lucius went on to become a successful real estate developer in Los Angeles. Evelyn worked briefly as a Hollywood publicist for Arthur Jacobs, whose clients included Grace Kelly, Gregory Peck, James Stewart and Marilyn Monroe. In her thirties, suddenly divorced and a single mother of four, Evelyn brought her entertainment savvy to managing the young acting career of her son Buddy best known as Ken Berry’s son in the series Mayberry RFD. At three, her youngest daughter Jodie landed her first commercial, the famed 60’s Coppertone ad. Evelyn successfully managed and guided her daughter’s career until her second Best Actress Oscar win in 1991 for The Silence of The Lambs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Paris was her second home where she loved spending time walking the streets with her grandchildren and collecting art for her apartment on the Ile de St. Louis. Always happiest surrounded by beautiful things, you would find her on Sundays amid a pile of art and architecture magazines. She was a passionate world cinema lover and a liberal firebrand, always ahead of her time, with an opinion about virtually everything and a voice for social justice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evelyn was without a doubt the strongest person her family has ever met, a champion, a fighter, full of fire and love. No one could beat her style, all five feet tall with naturally “cork screw” hair. Her family will remember those dimple smiles and big hugs and well placed four letter words. No one messed with Nana, an original like no other. May she live in all of us forever.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her family will mourn her passing privately. In lieu of flowers, they suggest you look up at the sky, open your arms and say her name. She would get a kick of that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52kw6qx0mihqJyZmnqnu9KtnKtlnaTCs7rSZqSopV2aw6a42Kdkn6ejqbKzew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./guy-accidentally-texts-screenshot.html><span>←</span><span>Guy Accidentally Texts Woman Screenshot of Her Instagram Pics Before First Date &amp;quot;You Can Hate Me</span></a>
