Many sites have reported that the No.1 Woman Italian tennis player, Martina, has tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Marco Parra, but there isn’t any proof.
They have also reported the couple has a child. This is false, as the child seen on Martina’s handle is her niece Emma."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

The Italian couple hasn’t shared any wedding or engagement pictures on their socials.</strong></p><p>Many sites have reported that the No.1 Woman Italian tennis player, Martina, has tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Marco Parra, but there isn’t any proof.</p><p>They have also reported the couple has a child. This is false, as the child seen on Martina’s handle is her niece Emma.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/martina-trevisan-husband.jpg><p>But Martina has shared romantic posts with her partner in the past, which makes us think that if she was engaged or married to Marco, she would’ve posted an update on her handle.&nbsp;</p><p>A former tennis prodigy who later dealt with health issues, <a href=# rel=noopener>Martina</a> made a stunning comeback after a four-year break in 2014. Last year she won her first maiden title, and today sits ahead of <a href=# rel=noopener>Jasmine Paolini</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Camila Giorgi</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Martina Trevisan Husband: Is She Married To Boyfriend Marco Parra?</h2><p>Martina Trevisan is yet to make her longtime boyfriend, Marco Parra, her husband.</p><p>Unlike reported by many sites, the couple doesn’t have a child. The little girl, Emma, seen on Martina’s Instagram, is her niece. The Italian tennis player went public with her relationship with Marco in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>She shared a romantic post of her getting a sweet kiss on her head by her partner on August 23, 2020. Martina didn’t write a lengthy caption and only placed a blue heart emoji on the post.&nbsp;</p><p>But the couple might have begun dating earlier than 2020. On July 8, 2019, on his Instagram handle, Marco shared a photo of him and Martina during their trip to France.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/martina-trevisan-boyfriend-marco-parra.jpg><p>In the photo shared by Marco, Martina was seen taking out stuff from their car as he snapped a quick selfie. He captioned the post, “To be continued.”</p><p>The couple celebrated Christmas 2020 together, with Marco sharing a couple of pictures two days after celebrating the festival. With Martina mostly sharing pictures of her tennis achievements on her social media handle, romantic posts take the backseat.</p><p>But even she couldn’t resist sharing an appreciation post for her beau on his birthday. On January 25, 2021, Martina shared a cute video of her and Marco on his 30th birthday. Trevisan captioned the post, “Life with you is better. Happy birthday MP.”</p><h2>Martina Trevisan And Her Supportive Boyfriend, Marco Parra&nbsp;</h2><p>The Italian tennis player hasn’t shared any wedding or engagement pictures to make us think she might’ve taken the next step with Marco.&nbsp;</p><p>From their romantic date nights to cycling trips, a video shared by Martina in 2021 clearly shows the two are head over heels for each other. But it doesn’t look like only Martina is the one in the relationship who loves staying fit.</p><p>Looking at Marco’s physique, a person might confuse him for an athlete. It isn’t known what Marco does for a living. But looking through his Instagram handle, the handsome Italian hunk seems to be a big fan of MotoGP.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/martina-trevisan-marco-parra.jpg><p>With 2022 being the year Martina won her first title, the couple closed out the fantastic year for the tennis player with a trip to the Maldives. Marco and Martina shared a few snaps from their vacation on social media handles.&nbsp;</p><p>In June, the couple enjoyed a weekend trip to Tenuta Zamparina resort. The trip came a few days before Martina took to the court at Bad Homburg Open.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC5wKuroqaRYsGzsdWiqpqmXZ3CtK7Ap5tmoaNiwKmxjKaYq6qZmrFuwM5mmaixlqe2prrDZqSaqpOkerGt0auYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mcleod-bethel-thompson.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | McLeod Bethel-Thompson net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
