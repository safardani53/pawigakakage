I know there was media speculation after the breakup, but that’s just all nonsense,” she said. “It’s just, that was such a toxic relationship. I was very happy to walk away from that relationship and have stayed strong throughout that journey. … The <a href=#>last time I saw [Tom]</a> was actually in person was when I shut the door on him.”</p><p>Darcey has since moved on and is now dating<strong> Georgi Rusev</strong>, who she first met online then in person in Miami during Super Bowl LIV. “He has a lot of great energy. His demeanor’s really fun. We had a lot of fieriness with us and he’s Bulgarian. He’s from there originally, but he lives in the States,” she shared with Us. “It’s been a really fun, exciting relationship and exciting to see where it goes”</p><p>In addition to seeing Darcey’s love life, fans will also get to know more about Stacey’s fiancé, <strong>Florian Sukaj</strong>. The pair met online and had an “instant connection” five years ago. He proposed six months in and she has made many trips to his native Albania.</p><p>“We had a long engagement and it was a pretty healthy relationship and we both wanted it to work,” she shared with Us, teasing that there’s “some drama that has happened” since. “It’s hard to talk about, but you know, it’s a part of it, and I lived it and I’m just trying to focus on the moment. I’m just blessed to have Darcey by my side to be there to support me.”</p><p>Darcey & Stacey premieres on TLC Sunday, August 16, at 10 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For more from the twins, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p>With reporting by Carla Sosenko</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuaqpOaxm6%2F05qanrFdqLatwsBmq56Zo5p6r7HWZqOorpVitq95mGlknZmpYrOqrc2cnGaroJ67sLLFaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sunnery-james-19790329-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sunnery James (DJ) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
