He was elected pope by the second papal conclave of 1978, which was called after John Paul I, who had been elected in August to succeed Pope Paul VI, died after 33 days. Cardinal Wojtyła was elected on the third day of the conclave and adopted the name of his predecessor in tribute to him. Born in Poland, John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI in the 16th century and the second-longest-serving pope after Pius IX in modern history. John Paul II attempted to improve the Catholic Church's relations with Judaism, Islam, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. He maintained the Church's previous positions on such matters as abortion, artificial contraception, the ordination of women, and a celibate clergy, and although he supported the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, he was seen as generally conservative in their interpretation.</p><table class=wikibox readability=33><tr><td class=wk_label>Church</td><td class=wk_value>Catholic Church</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Installed</td><td class=wk_value>16 October 1978</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Term ended</td><td class=wk_value>2 April 2005</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Predecessor</td><td class=wk_value>John Paul I</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Successor</td><td class=wk_value>Benedict XVI</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Ordination</td><td class=wk_value>1 November 1946, by Adam Stefan Sapieha</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Consecration</td><td class=wk_value>28 September 1958, by Eugeniusz Baziak</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Created Cardinal</td><td class=wk_value>26 June 1967, by Pope Paul VI</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Rank</td><td class=wk_value>Cardinal priest (1967–1978)</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Karol Józef Wojtyła</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>May 18, 1920, Wadowice, Second Polish Republic</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>April 02, 2005, Apostolic Palace, Vatican City</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Denomination</td><td class=wk_value>Catholic</td></tr><tr readability=8><td class=wk_label>Previous post</td><td class=wk_value>Auxiliary Bishop of Kraków, Poland (1958–1964), Titular Bishop of Ombi (1958–1964), Archbishop of Kraków, Poland (1964–1978), Cardinal Priest of San Cesareo in Palatio (1967–1978)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Education</td><td class=wk_value>Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (STL, PhD), Jagiellonian University (PhD)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Motto</td><td class=wk_value>Totus tuus, ('Totally yours')</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Feast day</td><td class=wk_value>22 October</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Venerated in</td><td class=wk_value>Catholic Church</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Beatified</td><td class=wk_value>1 May 2011, St. Peter's Square, Vatican City, by Benedict XVI</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Canonized</td><td class=wk_value>27 April 2014, St. Peter's Square, Vatican City, by Francis</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Attributes</td><td class=wk_value>Papal ferula, Papal vestments</td></tr><tr readability=15><td class=wk_label>Patronage</td><td class=wk_value>Poland, Archdiocese of Kraków, World Youth Day (co-Patron), World Meeting of Families 2015 (co-patron), Young Catholics, Families, Świdnica, Trecastelli, Borgo Mantovano, Rivignano Teor Paradahan, Tanza, Cavite</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Official Website</td><td class=wk_value>http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/index.htm</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/pope-john-paul-ii-k6sm-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Religious Leader Pope John Paul II was born with name Karol Józef Wojtyła was born on May 18, 1920 in Wadowice, Poland (He dies at the age of 84, on April 2, 2005).</p><p>From 1978 until 2005, he was the second-longest-serving pope in history, leading the Catholic Church.
