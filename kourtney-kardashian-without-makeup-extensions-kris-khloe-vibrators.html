I love you. This is amazing.”</p><p><a href=#>Khloe</a>, 37, also did a box unveiling by showing off the same items she received from her older sister.</p><h2 id=so-happy><strong>'SO HAPPY'</strong></h2><p>While holding up the sex serum, the&nbsp;TV star simply said: “Oh my.”</p><p>After showing off a gorgeous bouquet of flowers, Khloe said: “Kourt, I love you.
