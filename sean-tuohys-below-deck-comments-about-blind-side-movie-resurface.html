<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Sean Tuohy's 'Below Deck' Comments About 'Blind Side' Movie Resurface</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Sean Tuohy</strong> and <strong>Leigh Anne Tuohy</strong></a>‘s memorable appearance on <a href=#>Below Deck</a> has resurfaced <a href=#>amid their legal drama with <strong>Michael Oher</strong>.</a></p><p>In a season 5 episode, which originally aired in 2017 and has since been <a href=#>reshared by TikTok user @itsabigailadams</a>, Sean, 63, discussed his involvement in The Blind Side movie.</p><p>“The writer of the book, he and I went to school together since we were five years old,” Sean explained about author <strong>Michael Lewis.</strong> “So I get a call — <a href=#><strong>Steven Spielberg</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong></a> — I had to give them the rights to use our name, and I said, ‘I’ll give you the rights if I get to read the script and approve it or un-approve it.’ So, sure enough, seven months later we get an envelope in the mail.”</p><p>Sean and Leigh Anne, 63, mentioned their connection to the film multiple times while on board the yacht. The pair took in Oher, now 37, as a teenager before he played four seasons at Ole Miss and several years in the NFL. The Blind Side movie starred <a href=#><strong>Sandra Bullock</strong></a> as Leigh Anne, <a href=#><strong>Tim McGraw</strong> </a>as Sean and<a href=#> <strong>Quinton Aaron</strong> as Oher.</a></p><p>Earlier this week, Oher filed a 14-page petition against the Tuohys, <a href=#>claiming they never adopted him and kept him</a> from the profits of the 2009 movie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sean-Tuohy-s-Below-Deck-Comments-About-Blind-Side-Movie-Deal-Resurface.jpg><p>In legal documents obtained by Us Weekly on Monday, August 14, Oher alleged that the family convinced him to sign a document in 2004 and “consented on the basis that doing so would make him a member” but that did not provide him with a “familial relationship” over the years. Oher is now seeking to terminate the conservatorship and <a href=#>asking the court to prohibit the Tuohys from using his name</a> and likeness.</p><p>“I am disheartened by the revelation shared in the lawsuit today. This is a difficult situation for my family and me,” the athlete said in a statement to the New York Post on Monday. “I want to ask everyone to please respect our privacy at this time. For now, I will let the lawsuit speak for itself and will offer no further comment.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sean-Tuohy-s-Below-Deck-Comments-About-Blind-Side-Movie-Deal-Resurface-inline.jpg><p>Sean and Leigh Anne, for their part, issued a statement <a href=#>accusing Oher of trying to extort them.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When Michael Lewis, a friend of Sean’s since childhood, was approached about turning his book on Mr. Oher and the Tuohys into a movie about their family, his agents negotiated a deal where they received a small advance from the production company and a tiny percentage of net profits,” their lawyer <strong>Marty Singer</strong> told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, August 15. “They insisted that any money received be divided equally. And they have made good on that pledge.”</p><p>The statement continued: “The Tuohys opened their home to Mr. Oher, offered him structure, support and, most of all, unconditional love. They have consistently treated him like a son and one of their three children. His response was to threaten them, including saying that he would plant a negative story about them in the press unless they paid him $15 million.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqemZ5iwba7x7KqZpqVoby4ecOemqRlk6S6rrHNrapmmZKkwrV5waWgp5xdqLalsYympq%2BhlWK%2Fpr%2FUq52am5Vk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./felix-reveals-a-secret-to-oscar-on-the-odd-couple.html><span>←</span><span>Felix Reveals A Secret To Oscar On The Odd Couple</span></a>
