The actor explained he went for training sessions at that gym “very briefly” — and only for a movie role.</p><p>“I was in a film called The Green Hornet, which, for many reasons, was not a wonderful chapter of my life,” he told host <a href=#><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></a>. “One of which was [that] I had to work out a lot — just, depressingly, to achieve that look, which is not the most superhero-y look you could ever imagine. At my most fit, I was like <a href=#><strong>Chris Pratt</strong></a> at his by far least fit.”</p><p>This wasn’t even the first West anecdote that the Like Father star has shared on the NBC series. In a 2015 appearance, he said the 21-time Grammy winner had recently invited him and his wife to an impromptu Life of Pablo listening party in a van.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We went in his van, and he didn’t have the lyrics recorded, just beats,” Rogen recalled. “And he went through an entire album — like, 17 tracks — playing the beats on the laptop and then rapping the songs, but [very] close to my face, which is bizarre because you don’t know where to look. It’s like being in a strip club. You’re like, ‘Where do I look? Do I look in his eyes? Is that creepy or weird?’ … Me and my wife looked at each other, and we were like, ‘We’ll just bob [our heads]. This feels appropriate.’ And yeah, we were in there for, like, two and a half hours.”</p><p>Late Night With Seth Meyers airs on NBC on weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqerJhiv7CzxKdkpJmerrJuss6lo6ivlZl6rrGMmqmorZ6ZerW0xGaesqVdp7KktdOipaBlnaTDqrGMqqyorJWofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bill-murray-pf-changs.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Your New P.F.
