Jill looked relaxed as she had a beach bag next to her, at one point reaching for sunscreen to stay protected. Instead of sneakers, however, she stayed breezy in flip flops. Naturally, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>White House residents</a> were joined by plenty of Secret Service security, one of whom could be spotted right behind Joe as he was walking out to the beach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/joe-jill-biden-beach-tmz-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple, who wed in 1977, notably have a home in the Rehoboth Beach area, located in the&nbsp;Gordons Pond section of Cape Henlopen State Park. Biden made the North Shores real estate purchase back in 2017 for $2.7 million, also spending a reported $450,000 on a security fence. The postcard worthy 4,786-square-foot home includes six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a spacious kitchen, three fireplaces and naturally, decks and porches for the weather and views.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/joe-jill-biden-beach-tmz-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Joe and Jill first visited the house in 2021 before her 70th birthday, but have seemingly become regulars ever since — especially during warm weather season. “Throughout our careers, Jill and I have dreamed of being able to buy a place where we can bring the whole family,” Joe said in a statement run by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Cape Gazette</a> back in 2017 after purchasing the property.&nbsp;“We feel very lucky that we’re now able to make that happen and are looking forward to spending time with our family in the place that matters most to us in the world,” the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grandfather of seven</a> also said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49yZqOnlWKvqrDEp2SsoJ%2BnwbR5wZ6YnKBdn7atuIypn6isn6h8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./karen-kingsbury.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Karen Kingsbury net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
