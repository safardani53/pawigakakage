A few years after her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>drama-filled split</a> from Charlie, Denise adopted daughter Eloise as a single parent. Denise has since gotten remarried to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aaron Phypers</strong></a>, and together the couple are now Eloise’s legal parents.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As fans know, Denise’s relationship with Charlie was tumultuous, both during and after their marriage. Recently, Charlie was granted approval by a judge to <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>no longer pay&nbsp;child support</a> for Sami and Lola. This legal development came after Sami reportedly moved in with Charlie due to a disagreement “over her mother’s rules.” Below, everything you need to know about Denise Richards’ three children.</p><h2><strong>Sami Sheen</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/denise-richards-kids-sami-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Denise and Charlie’s eldest child, daughter <strong>Sami</strong>, was born on March 9, 2004. When Sami was only 1 years old, Denise filed a restraining order against Charlie — marking the most turbulent moment of the couple’s marriage yet. Denise officially filed for divorce the following month, and the divorce was finalized on November 30, 2006. Following a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gnarly custody battle</a>, Denise was given primary physical custody of their two kids, while Charlie got visitation rights.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>But in the years since, Sami has spent time with both her parents. She appeared on&nbsp;RHOBH&nbsp;when Denise <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>was a main cast member</a> on seasons 9 and 10 of the hit Bravo series. As for Charlie, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Two and a Half Men</a>&nbsp;actor was seen in a photo at&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sami’s 17th birthday</a>, alongside Lola and Denise. Sami’s bond with her father even transpired to the teen’s recent decision to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>move in with her father</a>. A source told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in September, “Sami is a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> teenager</a>, who didn’t like her mother’s rules. Like any mother and household, there are rules in Denise’s. She and Charlie have different rules and styles of parenting and [they] didn’t see eye to eye. Sami decided she liked Charlie’s rules better and wanted to go and live with her father, where she currently is staying. Denise is incredibly saddened by all of this, but knows she is doing her best as a mother.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Sami <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reflected on her 2021</a> in late Dec., calling her time living at her dad’s house “a very lovely year”. And an insider previously revealed to <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that Charlie loves being with his girls. Talking to us EXCLUSIVELY, they said, “Charlie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>loves all of his children</a> very much. He’s a total girl dad and has a super soft spot for his daughters.”</p><h2><strong>Lola Rose Sheen</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/denise-richards-kids-lola-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>Lola</strong>, Denise and Charlie’s second child together, was born on June 1, 2005. While Denise was pregnant with Lola, she had filed the restraining order against Charlie. Lola was less than two years old when her parents were officially divorced. In the following years, Lola, like Sami, seemingly spent most of her time living with Denise, while also seeing Charlie on occasion. But both girls started spending more time with their famous dad as time went on, culminating in Sami recently moving in with her dad permanently. Lola, meanwhile, has been said to be <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>splitting her time evenly</a> between her parents.</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-4=processed>“Lola splits time between both Charlie and Denise’s homes,” our insider said, “but Denise has been the primary caretaker for the girls for years. Denise is very saddened by all of this. She’s an incredible mother who loves her kids and would do anything in the world for them.”</p><p data-skm-boomerang-el-4=processed>It seemed Lola is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>growing up fast</a>. Her mom announced her daughter had gotten her driver’s license on Jan. 1. 2022. “Woohoo!!! Nothing like celebrating 2022 than my Lola getting her driver’s license!!!! I’m so proud of you & so happy for you Lolee!!!” Denise captioned the Instagram.</p><h2><strong>Eloise Joni Richards</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/denise-richards-kids-eloise-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Over 4 years after Denise split from Charlie, the actress decided to adopt a third child, daughter<strong> Eloise.&nbsp;</strong>Denise adopted Eloise at birth following a two-year-long process, and gave her the middle name Joni after Denise’s mother. Eloise has <strong>Chromosome 8, Monosomy 8p</strong>, a rare&nbsp;chromosomal disorder that causes developmental delays.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Denise previously gushed over her youngest child in a May 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parents.com</a>. “We’ve grown with her since she was a baby,” Denise said. “But she’s a sweet little angel and the happiest little girl and the littlest things make her so happy.” Denise also shared that Eloise was nicknamed the “animal whisperer” because of her communication tactics with the family’s pets. “She communicates in other ways with our animals. It is so sweet and so special to see that relationship,” Denise said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Denise initially raised Eloise solo, but that all changed when she <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married Aaron</a> in September 2018. After a few months, Denise revealed that Aaron was officially adopting Eloise as his own daughter. “He’s amazing as a daddy,” she said on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Talk</a> in May 2019. “He’s amazing with my daughters and he’s adopting my youngest so it’s really great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OepaKrlWK%2Fqq%2FHmqmdq12gtqW%2FjG1sbGxibYBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-knowings.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Knowings- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
