The actor was first accused of sexual assault back <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>in 2017</a>, but in 2020, he was arrested and charged with allegedly raping three women between the years, 2001 and 2003.

In December of 2023, his first mugshot was released after he was transferred to a state prison.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Find out more about Danny’s sentencing and his prison details below.</p><h2>Is Danny Masterson in Prison?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Danny-masterson-sentencing-prison-details-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Before he was sentenced, Danny, whose wife <strong>Bijou Phillips</strong> filed for divorce after his sentencing, stayed in L.A. County Men’s Central Jail for months. After his sentencing, which took place on September 7, 2023, he was taken back right away and was awaiting to be transferred to a California state prison, where he would serve both of his sentences, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>On December 27, after Danny was admitted to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>North Kern State Prison</a> in Delano, California, the Los Angeles County Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation released a first mugshot of the actor. In a photo you can see via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six,</a> the actor donned a typical orange prison jumpsuit layered with a light brown shirt. His hair and beard had seemingly grown longer, and his eyes appeared bloodshot as he smiled slightly for the snapshot.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>On December 31, the schedule for Danny’s first 90 days in prison was released by<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> TMZ</a>. He reportedly has to go through a reception and classification process that could last the first 90 days, and will be in a group called privilege group U. His group reportedly also has strict restrictions, including no family visits, limited entertainment access and no access to personal property. He reportedly got one phone call within the first week of entering the facility, and then for the remainder of his time in group U, he only gets one call per month, according to the CA Department of Corrections.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Danny will apparently still have access to things like the yard and recreation services, but he won’t get his full prison privileges until the classification process has finished.</p><h2>What Is Prison like for Danny Masterson?</h2><p id=cb-1e722eff2290cb71126ec594bf2cb6e7 class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default" data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'>Danny is under 24-hour video surveillance, and deputies come by his cell every 30 minutes to check on him, according to TMZ. The goal of the frequent check-ins is to see how his mental state is and to make sure he’s safe. If he shows any signs of <span>mental distress or tells his team or a deputy about a mental health issue, he would be taken for a mental health exam right away, the outlet also reported.&nbsp;</span>As far as how Danny feels after the sentencing, his lawyer <strong>Shawn Holley</strong>, told TMZ that he is “mentally strong and feels confident that his conviction will be overturned on appeal, based on his meetings with several top appellate attorneys.”</p><h2>How many Years Was Danny Masterson sentenced to Prison?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Danny-masterson-sentencing-prison-details-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>LA Superior Court Judge <strong>Charlaine F. Olmedo</strong> sentenced Danny to a total of 30 years in prison, which includes two separate 15-year sentences for each count of rape. He will be serving them consecutively. The sentencing happened after the judge rejected a defense motion for a new trial and the sentence, itself, was the maximum allowed by law.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“Mr. Masterson, you are not the victim here. Your actions 20 years ago took away another person’s voice and choice. Your actions 20 years ago were criminal, and that is why you are here,” the judge said to Danny at the sentencing, per <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.</p><h2>What Will Danny Masterson’s Release Date Be?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Since he was served a total of 30 years in prison, Danny wouldn’t be released until around 2053, the year he’ll turn 77 years old. Due to the guidelines of his sentencing, Danny will be eligible for parole after 25 1/2 years, but he could remain in prison the rest of his life, depending on any changes that could happen between now and then.</p><h2>Danny’s Relationship With Bijou</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Two weeks after he was sentenced, Bijou <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> on September 19, but she was seen still <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wearing her wedding ring</a> in the first photos taken after the filing. She also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>requested spousal support</a> from him in court documents, obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>As the pair’s divorce continues, Danny agreed to give his ex-wife <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>full legal and physical custody</a> of their daughter&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Fianna Francis</a>,&nbsp;</strong>9. The&nbsp;That 70s Show&nbsp;alum requested visitation, which would need to be granted by prison officials, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.&nbsp;In a statement, she showed her commitment to parenting their child. “Ms. Phillips has decided to file for divorce from her husband during this unfortunate time. Her priority remains with her daughter,” Bijou’s lawyer told the outlet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OapaexXaKutMDEq6qopl2osq%2FAxKeaoqaXYr2ztdKopWatoJmutbHSZmxqbmVuhnJ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./niana-guerrero.html><span>←</span><span>Niana Guerrero Biography, Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth</span></a>
