The pair got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">engaged</a> in October&nbsp;2015, and a little over a year later, they said their “I dos.” <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>On November 11, 2016, the couple got married on the occasion of Guiney’s father’s birthday.
