From his work with his Simon And Garfunkel partner <strong>Art Garfunkel&nbsp;</strong>to his solo work, he’s been revered for generations. The&nbsp;Graceland&nbsp;singer has earned 16 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy Awards</a> throughout his career and explored a multitude of genres. While he announced that he’d retire from live performances in 2018, he has occasionally made special appearances and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>performances</a> since his farewell tour, and his music continues to be adored by fans of all ages, and he regularly reflects on his career highlights on his <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Most recently, the 81-year-old took to Instagram to announce an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>upcoming exhibition</a> in London inspired by his Seven Psalms album. “Paul Simon and Oscar-winning British illustrator @charliemackesy launch an exciting new creative project with an exhibition of Charlie’s sketches at @friezeofficial: No. 9 Cork Street, London – inspired by Paul’s critically acclaimed ‘Seven Psalms’ album. The free public exhibition runs in London from September 13th-27th,” the caption read on Aug. 10, 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Throughout his career, Paul has not shied away from writing about his love life, and some of his biggest hits, including&nbsp;“50 Ways To Leave Your Lover” have been inspired by his relationships. Paul has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married three times</a>, including to his wife&nbsp;<strong>Edie Brickell,&nbsp;</strong>who he’s been wed to since 1992. Find out more about all of Paul’s relationships here!</p><h2>Edie Brickell</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Simons-Wife-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Paul’s longest-lasting marriage has been to his wife Edie, 57, to who he’s been wed since 1992. Like “The Sound Of Silence” star, Edie is also a singer-songwriter, and she’s released nine albums both on her own and with her group New Bohemians. She’s also participated in other musical projects like the bands The Heavy Circles and The Gaddabouts, and in 2013, she released a collaborative album with comedy icon <strong>Steve Martin&nbsp;</strong>Love Has Come For You.&nbsp;She teamed up with him again to write the music for the Broadway show&nbsp;Bright Star.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Music was actually how Edie and Paul first met. She recalled seeing the iconic singer watch her perform her song “What I Am,” during an appearance on&nbsp;Saturday Night Live.&nbsp;She said she saw him in front of a cameraman during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mirror</a>.&nbsp;“Even though I’d performed the song hundreds of times in clubs, he made me forget how the song went when I looked at him,” she said. “We can show the kids the tape and say, ‘Look, that’s when we first laid eyes on each other.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>During their 30-year marriage, Paul and Edie have had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three children</a>:&nbsp;<strong>Adrian,&nbsp;</strong>30,&nbsp;<strong>Lulu,&nbsp;</strong>28, and <strong>Gabriel,&nbsp;</strong>25. While their marriage has been Paul’s longest-lasting, it hasn’t been without challenges. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>couple were both arrested</a> for disorderly conduct in 2014 in their Connecticut home. They were both given misdemeanor summons, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian.</a>&nbsp;Despite the hiccup, it appears the couple patched things up and are still going strong in their relationship.</p><h2>Carrie Fisher</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-Simons-Wife-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>After dating&nbsp;<strong>Shelley Duvall </strong>for a few years, Paul began a relationship with her friend&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Carrie Fisher</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and the pair got married in 1983. The&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;actress, who <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>passed away in 2016</a> at age 60, had an on-and-off relationship with Paul through the end of the 70s and the start of the 80s. Even though they had many breakups, it was clear they still shared love for one another. “We still care very much for each other. There is nobody else like Carrie. She’s got one of the fastest, funniest minds I know. She is absolutely unique,” Paul told People&nbsp;in 1983, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>InStyle</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Weeks after the 1983 split, the couple reunited once again, but this time, they exchanged vows in a New York wedding ceremony with tons of stars like&nbsp;<strong>Billy Joel, Lorne Michaels, Christie Brinkley,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>George Lucas&nbsp;</strong>in attendance. The pair broke up again in 1984, but reconciled once again shortly after, and they kept dating until the end of the decade.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Many of Paul’s songs were inspired by Carrie. “Hearts And Bones” and “She Moves On” are about their time together and breakup, and the track “Graceland” is often thought to be about when the marriage ended. Even though they may not have always been the nicest, Carrie did admit that she liked the songs in her 2016 interview with<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;Rolling Stone.</a> “I do like the songs he wrote about our relationship. Even when he’s insulting me, I like it very much. If you’re gonna be insulted, that’s the way to go. ‘Graceland’ has part of us in it,” she said. After <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Carrie’s passing</a> in 2016, Paul wrote a touching memorial to her in a since-deleted <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a>. “Yesterday was a horrible day. Carrie was a special, wonderful girl. It’s too soon,” he wrote, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Shelley Duvall</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Paul-simon-shelly-shutter-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-15>Before he met Carrie, Paul dated&nbsp;Annie Hall&nbsp;actress Shelley Duvall, 74, from 1976 until 1977. Not much is known about the relationship, but it has been reported that Shelley was the one who introduced Paul to the Star Wars&nbsp;actress, which led to the beginning of their on-off relationship in the 70s.</p><h2>Peggy Harper</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Paul’s first marriage was to&nbsp;<strong>Peggy Harper&nbsp;</strong>in 1969. The pair welcomed Paul’s oldest son <strong>Harper Simon, </strong>50, who is a songwriter himself, in 1971. While the pair ended up divorcing in 1975, the period that they were together did serve as much inspiration for him. His 1972 track “Run That Body Down” includes references to himself and Peggy by name. The song “50 Ways To Leave Your Lover” was also released the year after the couple divorced. Years after the split, Paul revisited their relationship with his 1983 song “Train In The Distance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BarKVlo566sLqMsKCfnV1phnp8lm1naA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-hudson-in-bikini-pic-yep-my-a-star-star-is-photoshopped.html><span>←</span><span>Yep, My A** Is Photoshopped!</span></a>
