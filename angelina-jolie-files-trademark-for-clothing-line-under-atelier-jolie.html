On the red carpet, Jolie opts for figure-flattering gowns from major fashion houses. At the <a href=#>Eternals premiere</a> during the 16th Rome Film Festival in October 2021, the California native was a metallic dream in a Versace dress. The floor-length garb, which was made custom for Jolie, featured a strapless neckline, a cinched waist and gathered detailing at the skirt. The silver fabric clung to her physique, making her look statuesque.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Angelina-Jolie-Starting-a-Clothing-Line-489-508.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>She also stepped out in the luxury label to attend the <a href=#>2018 Golden Globes</a>. Showing her support for the Time’s Up movement, her dress was black and featured sheer, feather-adorned sleeves.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>One of her most standout Versace moments came at the<a href=#> 2012 Oscars</a>. She got leggy in a high-slit garment that later made meme history due to her sultry red carpet poses.&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While Jolie favors dark shades, she has unveiled her fair share of colorful ensembles. She was a glowing sight at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008, donning a whimsical green gown by Max Azria Atelier that fell perfectly over her baby bump. (She was pregnant with twins Vivienne and Knox — with whom she shares with ex <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a> — at the time. The former couple, who split in 2016, also share Maddox, Zahara, Shiloh and Pax.)&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jolie’s off-duty style is just as eye-catching. In July 2022, she managed to make pajamas look chic. She was photographed arriving at London’s Heathrow Airport, <a href=#>wearing a silky coffee-colored set</a> from Valentino.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The outfit featured a loose-fitting button up and a pair of coordinating pants. The Salt star paired the ensemble with rounded sunglasses and chocolate slides also from the Italian fashion house. The leather sandals were designed with the brand’s logo in gold atop a thick brown strap. The Oscar winner also accessorized with YSL’s popular black quilted tote.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a7qLHLoqWaZZqkuaqxjJ%2BgpZ2jYsGzrcOepJqqm2KzsL6MnKOorJieu6h5y6KlnmWlo7Gmvoyaq56kmZq%2FbrbOpaCeZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adolfo-dominguez.html><span>←</span><span>Adolfo Dominguez</span></a>
