Shay, 35, did a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TikTok duet</a> with another content creator who asked, “if you identify as bisexual… do you own a green velvet couch?”, to which she replied by plopping down on her own couch of the same color. And on Monday, Em showed off her own light-green plush couch with an adorable side-eye and smile.</p><a title=@emrata href=# rel=nofollow>@emrata</a><p id=content-paragraph-3><a title=stitch href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#stitch</a> with @shaymitchell</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><a title="♬ original sound - Emrata" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – Emrata</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>People in the comments section have been rejoicing the news since the 31-year-old posted the video one month after she filed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>for divorce</a> from her ex, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sebastian Bear-McClard</strong></a>. “W for the ladies,” one fan wrote, while another chimed in, “So many celeb women are coming out and I just love it.” And many others were left in disbelief by the news, with one user even writing, “EMRATA!? AM I DREAMING.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Along with Emily and Shay, pop icon <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Madonna</strong></a>, 64, even shared a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>video on TikTok</a> seemingly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>coming out</a> as “gay” on Oct. 9. So Em’s post marks the third female celebrity to seemingly come out as a member of the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>LGBT community</a> in the last week! All of the women’s posts have been mostly received well by their followers. One of Madonna’s fans took to the comments section to write, “Did I just witness Madonna coming out, good for her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Emily-Ratajkowski-bisexual-ss-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Emily is no stranger on talking about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexuality</a> via a public platform either. The Gone Girl actress spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Allure </a>magazine in July 2017 about sexuality and finding strength through it. “I found my sexuality and my identity. I found empowerment through that,” Em said at the time. Notably, the interview did not address whether she identifies as bisexual or not.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The bombshell</a> has been married to Sebastian since 2018, but has since decided to separate from him. On Sept. 9, a friend of Emily’s told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a> that her estranged husband had been unfaithful to her. “Yeah, he cheated,” the source told the outlet. “He’s a serial cheater. It’s gross. He’s a dog.” Sebastian and the former iCarly star share one son together, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sylvester Apollo Bear</strong></a>, 1, who was born in March 2021. <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>has reached out to Emily’s reps for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BpZp6lmaHGbr7ArZijo5%2BswKy1jJugrJ2oqq6tedOioq2nm2LDqrDEqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./demi-lovato-and-trace-cyrus-its-over.html><span>←</span><span>Demi Lovato and Trace Cyrus: It's Over</span></a>
