The 40-year-old protested the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade, which removed government protection of abortion rights.&nbsp;Netizens flocked to social media to voice their displeasure with the police’ “manhandling” of the actress, who portrayed Stephanie Tanner on Full House.</p><p>During a demonstration, Jodie Sweetin was seen on camera shouting into a microphone on the motorway. Several cops then shoved her, sending her sliding to the ground. The actress then stood up, fixed her baseball hat, and chanted, “No justice, no peace.”&nbsp;One demonstrator was heard yelling to the cop as the actress was being forced to the ground:</p><p>“What the f**k happened to you guys?”</p><p>According to freelance photographer Michael Ade, the demonstrators were conducting a peaceful demonstration on the motorway with Jodie Sweetin. The actress, who portrayed Stephanie Tanner on Full House, was thrown to the ground at that point.&nbsp;Ade also shared a video on Instagram showing demonstrators being shoved by police officers with batons.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jodie-Sweetin-2.jpg alt="Jodie Sweetin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The LAPD sent a statement to People magazine in response to Jodie Sweetin being thrown down. They said that they would investigate the officer who was responsible for this.</p><p>According to the LAPD:</p><p>“The Los Angeles Police Department is aware of a video recording showing a lady being shoved to the ground by police who refused to allow the group to enter on foot and hijack the 101 highway.” The use of force will be examined in light of LAPD policy and practice.”</p><h2>The internet responds to law officers shoving Jodie Sweetin</h2><p>Netizens were taken aback after seeing police officers physically abuse demonstrators who were allegedly peacefully demonstrating. Many people felt that Sweetin’s treatment by officers was unjustified. Some also used previous school shootings to argue that police would only assault peaceful demonstrators and not protect schools from shooters.&nbsp;A few tweets in response to Jodie Sweetin being dragged over by cops read:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Look at this. Police officers assaulting actress Jodie Sweetin. Throwing her body against concrete. Why won’t Fox News cover this? Why won’t any Republicans condemn this? Police feel emboldened to assault women now that the Republicans have declared them second-class citizens. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/NmOl056LND</a></p><p>— Dash Dobrofsky (@DashDobrofsky) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tell me again why the police deserve our respect?</p><p>— JorgePosadaBelongsInCooperstown (@Jamiehop27) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2022</a></p><h2>Jodie Sweetin’s representative said the actress is “fine.”</h2><p>Sweetin was “OK” after the demonstration, according to a spokeswoman for the Beyond the Edge actress. In a statement sent by her publicist, the actress said that she was delighted to witness numerous individuals opposing the repeal of abortion rights.&nbsp;She also verified that the demonstrators marched in unison, rendering the police’ response unjustified. Her statement read as follows:</p><p>“I’m incredibly pleased of the hundreds of folks that came out yesterday to utilize their First Amendment rights and take direct action to oppose the massive injustices handed down by our Supreme Court.” We will continue to campaign until our voices are heard and action is implemented. This will not dissuade us from continuing to fight for our rights. We will not be free until we are all free.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Jodie-Sweetin-3.jpg alt="Jodie Sweetin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The rally in which the actress took part was the second in a series of protests taking place around the United States. Protests are taking place in response to the US Supreme Court’s 5-4 Roe v Wade decision issued on Friday.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihqJyZmnq0w8Seq6KmXayutHnSpZimpZWZerW7jK2fnmWXp7y2usNmmbJlnJZ6sbvLopqeZZ%2Bbs6qvxKuqZpmkYq5uvNGoZJygn56wpnnRmqOlsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wales-wife-list.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Wale Dating Wale's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
