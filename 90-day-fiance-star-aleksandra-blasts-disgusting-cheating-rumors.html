No one likes being accused of being unfaithful, but it’s worse when these trolls claim that Aleksandra and Josh’s daughter, Kaya, must not be Josh’s at all.
And on top of that, these racially charged accusations have singled out Aleksandra’s best friend from back in Prague."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

As soon as their lives are no longer in hiatus, their problems will be more or less solved, right?</p><p>Except that people are terrible.</p><p>So, Aleksandra&nbsp;stopped posting to Instagram over the summer, and both she and Josh have stopped sharing images of their daughter, Kaya.</p><p>Because the first time that they did, Instagram trolls flooded Aleksandra’s comments with accusations that she cheated on Josh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Why?</p><p>Part of it’s probably because they don’t want to believe that someone can change their life.</p><p>But part of it’s because Kaya’s skin is darker than that of either of her parents. And her hair is dark and curly.</p><p>So these accusers think that Kaya is biracial and definitely not Josh’s.</p><p>Aleksandra already explained — even though she totally didn’t have to — that her own biological father is Cuban.</p><p>(As most people are aware from their own families, it’s not uncommon for children to inherit traits from their grandparents that are not exhibited by their own parents. I think that it has something to do with RNA but don’t quote me on that.)</p><p>Well, trolls have set their sights on a number of potential baby daddies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Including the black man with whom Aleksandra&nbsp;spent time in Prague.</p><p>(Again, these accusations have a strong racial element which should make everyone involved uncomfortable)</p><p>Because that man is "just like a brother" to Aleksandra, she’s not only offended but repulsed.</p><p>"That’s even disgusting to think about possible feelings between us. He promised him to protect me in Prague while Josh is far away."</p><p>So these accusers are impugning this man’s honor as much as they are Aleksandra.</p><p>Other "theories" are that it wasn’t cheating, that maybe Josh is impotent or sterile or gay or whatever.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>90 Day Fiance: Which Couples Are (Somehow) Still Together?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><p>But honestly — bullying like this always has the same motive. These people want to feel powerful by dragging down a "celebrity."</p><p>You might suggest that Aleksandra and Josh get a paternity test on camera (maybe 90 Day Fiance could foot the bill) and settle the matter that way.</p><p>You know what? They don’t owe their haters anything.</p><p>They have every right to just keep living their lives.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WGcIWPZpuasV2btqK6wp5krKyRp3qiuMSkqpqmlKeubq7Lmqqtq12ZtrSz1KyroqaXYrCpscCtoKefXafCrrvRrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-shauna-sand-sighting.html><span>←</span><span>A Shauna Sand Sighting!</span></a>
