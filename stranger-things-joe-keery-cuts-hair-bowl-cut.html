His hair, no longer his iconic bigger, blowdried look, had been cut to just above his ear with chopped bangs in front. He also sported some scruffy facial hair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keery’s hair launched to fame after the first season of the beloved sci-fi series hit Netflix back in 2016, and launched plenty of memes after the second season aired in 2017.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Joe Keery.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images; Stefanie Keenan/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In season 2, Keery’s character Steve Harrington teaches Gaten Matarazzo’s character Dustin how to get his ’80s look just right, telling him, “It’s Fabergé Organics.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Use the shampoo and the conditioner, and when the hair is damp — it’s not wet, OK? When it’s damp — do four puffs of the Farrah Fawcett spray,” he explains in the show.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But unlike his character, Keery doesn’t use a lot of product on his hair. “It’s my parents’ fault, really, because they have such big hair too. People always ask me, but it’s not like I use a shitload of hairspray or anything,” he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>previously told GQ</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Charlie Heaton (left) and Joe Keery.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Buckner/WWD/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For a long time, my dad was always on me about cutting my hair,” Keery said back in 2017 when he appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers, saying that his dad told him he needed to reign in his envious volume. “It’s too big, get it down,” he recalled his dad telling him when he was growing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By Friday, fans had noticed Keery’s hair transformation, and many didn’t shy away from voicing their disappointment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>one Twitter user</a> wrote next to a photo of his new look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“in loving memory of joe keery,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>another</a> wrote on Twitter. “he ain’t dead but his hair is”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Daniel Zuchnik/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Yet <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>another</a> even wrote his hair a eulogy: “Let’s take a moment of silence to remember Joe Keery. He was an absolute shining star ultimate hair goals. He will forever remain in our hearts. RIP mullet man”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it’s certainly a different look for the actor, could the change be in preparation for an upcoming role?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keery has been known to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>transform his body</a> when needed to get into character. To get ready for season 1 of Stranger Things, he worked out for six weeks because Steve was originally going to be a swimmer, and he thought he was going to have to appear in a speedo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“But then we show up the first day and they’re like, ‘Oh the swimmer? Oh yeah we cut that,’” Keery told Meyers, laughing. “It was the most in-shape I’ve ever been.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqyrq5menLKzedOhoKefo2K3sLGMpJyeqqlisLbA0mafmqGiYq%2Bww8tmmq6sXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-used-car-buys-under-5000.html><span>←</span><span>I'm a motors expert... here's the best used cars you can buy for under 5,000 - but make sure you'v</span></a>
