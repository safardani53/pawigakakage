On the other hand, they agree the quality time is much-needed — especially since they’re getting ready to reaffirm their relationships with a commitment celebration.</p><p><span>Meri’s Meltdown</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Taking this trip is kind of like us putting our relationships as sisters wives as a priority,” Robyn says.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Unfortunately the sister wives’ shopping spree in San Francisco&nbsp;gets off to a rocky start when they can’t find a store that sells dresses in a wide range of sizes. The first store they hit, Elizabeth Charles, only has dresses that will fit Robyn’s slim figure, which makes the rest of the sister wives feel discouraged and uncomfortable. How awkward!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The next day, they hit a plus-size clothing store and Robyn is the odd wife out. In the end, none of the wives are happy with the stores’ selections so they decide to go to fabric warehouse to pick out material and have custom dresses made.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The wives ultimately agree that they don’t all have to wear the same color or the same dress, so they agree to pick a color scheme instead. This way, they will all feel unique and beautiful on their big day! What a great idea — and a great way for them to bond!</p><h3><strong>Kody Struggles To Care For His 15 Kids</strong></h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, in Las Vegas, Kody comes up with a plan to make his wifeless week easier. He decides to grill a ton of meat on the first night so the kids will be able to eat leftovers for days.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“You can’t really screw up grilling, can you?” Kody asks naively. Sounds simple enough — until his daughter Ysabel stubs her toe in the middle of the grill-athon!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>While Kody is patching Ysabel up, he forgets about the steaks he left on the grill and burns them! Oops!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The day after the grilling fiasco, Kody decides to take the kids’ to the neighbors’ pool. He thinks he’s got it all figured out and is relaxing in the hot tub when his three older daughters throw him for a loop by asking him if any boys have asked for his permission to court them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Kody quickly says that at 17 and 18, they’re all too young to be thinking about romance. “I want them to have some education,” he says. “I want them to go to college first.” He’s definitely not the first dad to feel that way!</p><h3>Kody Makes An Awkward Call To The Wives</h3><p id=content-paragraph-12>Kody wants to check in with his wives while they’re away so he decides to call Christine. He makes the call while the wives are in the middle of lunch and they pass the phone around so each of them can have a turn to talk to him. Unfortunately the wives feel really uncomfortable talking to their husband in front of each other. Another awkward moment.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The Browns definitely still have some kinks to work out in their complex relationships, but at least they’re trying!</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>When the wives finally come home, Kody has never looked so happy to see them. The ladies are equally thrilled to be back where they belong, but they all admit that they had a much better time than they expected on their trip. Success!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>So&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think the sister wives’ trip strengthened their relationships?
