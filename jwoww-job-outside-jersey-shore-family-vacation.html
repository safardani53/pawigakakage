Even if she's not shy about sharing many aspects of it with the world.</p><p>JWoww has said in interviews that she treats Jersey Shore like a job, and some of her fellow cast members like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">co-workers</a>.

She started the website <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miss Domesticated</a> in 2016 so she could spend some of her spare time outside of reality TV to pursue another one of her passions — blogging.</p><p>The website is dedicated to celebrity and entertainment news, but also fashion, food, parenting, and everything in between. Jenni's goal with Miss Domesticated is to deliver smaller articles that are quick and easy to read for her fans.</p><p>And it also offers her and her small team on the website a chance to show another facet of her talent.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>In 2011, JWoww published a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">self-help book</a> of sorts called The Rules According to JWOWW: Shore-Tested Secrets on Landing a Mint Guy, Staying Fresh to Death, and Kicking the Competition to the Curb.

And before she became a reality TV star, she worked a couple of different jobs. She was a graphic designer at one point, so running her own website makes total sense. But, she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a> in 2012, she also worked with the elderly in a nursing home at one point.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I worked at a nursing home, that sucked," JWoww said. "Bitter old people, I felt bad, some are just God-awful, the others are just lovable and I want to take home and hang out with, [and] some are just mean."</p><p>It's safe to say that JWoww left that particular job behind once MTV came calling. And can you really blame her?</p><p>These days, <a href=#>JWoww's net worth</a> sits at an estimated $4 million. Most of that is likely from Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. It has been her "job" for the past several years, after all.</p><p>JWoww isn't slowing down, though, and unlike some other cast members, she has remained a steady presence on the show.</p><p>Watch Jersey Shore: Family Vacation on Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8Sww9ZmoaiaXaTCtb%2FInZxmopWnwKbFjKyfqKqVYrOiucilsGaukZiutbXOpw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leah-messer-massive-tax-debt-revealed-could-she-go-to-jail.html><span>←</span><span>MASSIVE Tax Debt Revealed!
