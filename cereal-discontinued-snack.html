CHICKEN & WAFFLES</h2><p>Chicken & Waffles from Post was one of​​ several new cereal flavors the company put out in 2019.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Discontinued Items">Read More on Discontinued Items</h2><p>A spin on Honey Bunches of Oats, the cereal had its iconic flakes and clusters but with maple-flavored, waffle-shaped, and drumstick-shaped pieces flavored with real poultry seasoning.</p><p>The back of the box described it as: “Sweet & savory unite in a flavor-intense cereal that combines chicken & waffles flavored goodness for a unique breakfast experience!”</p><p>While the cereal was only created for National Cereal Day, it was short-lived much to fans’ dismay.</p><h2>2. CINNAMON MINI BUNS</h2><p>Kellogg's Cinnamon Mini Buns was a popular cereal back in the 1990s that many companies have tried to recreate since then.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/TP-CEREAL5jpg-JS808849445.jpg><p>The cereal was made with corn, whole-grain oats, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.</p><p>Television ads described the cereal: "They're like cinnamon buns... the size of cereal.”</p><p>Since being discontinued, the company has made many variations of the bite-sized buns, including Mini Swirlz Cereal Cinnamon Bun, Frosted Mini Wheats Cinnamon Roll flavors, and even partnering with Cinnabun.</p><p>However, some fans say those don’t compare to the '90s classic.</p><p>One Twitter user wrote: “Kellogg's Cinnamon Mini Buns RIP was the greatest cereal ever but it's been discontinued for years!”</p><h2>3. CHOCO DONUTS</h2><p>Cap'n Crunch Choco Donuts from Quaker was advertised as the greatest mistake using “Oops!” as its marketing ploy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/TP-CEREAL4jpg-JS808849396.jpg><p>The cereal was chocolate rings, in the shape of donuts of course, with colorful sprinkles on top.</p><p>While the sugary cereal was advertised as a “mistake,” fans bought it up in droves, which is why it hurt so many when the company discontinued it in the early 2000s.</p><p>That didn’t stop the public from getting it back though - or at least trying to.</p><p>Dedicated cereal lovers started a <a href=#>petition</a> about a decade ago to bring the chocolatey donuts back.</p><h2>4. YUMMY MUMMY</h2><p>General Mills loves a good Monster cereal as in the past it created Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Count Chocula, and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/TP-CEREAL1jpg-JS808849393.jpg><p>Decades ago, the cereal maker tried its hand at something different - mummies.</p><p>Originally called Frute Brute, the company later changed it to Fruity Yummy Mummy.</p><p>The cereal was around in the late '80s and early '90s and was typically produced as a spooky special from September to October.</p><p>Each box was a fruit flavor, frosted cereal with bat marshmallows inside - and sometimes a mystery prize.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The U.S. Sun revealed <a href=#>five discontinued</a> nostalgic ice cream truck treats.</p><p>Plus, fans will never see these <a href=#>nostalgic sweet</a> snacks again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIV0fpdvbmiblaeyoriMnaCsm5%2Bjwaq61J6bZquelrCsew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./daniel-sarcos.html><span>←</span><span>Fame | Daniel Sarcos net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</span></a>
