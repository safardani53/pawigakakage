The fan favourite labelled talkSPORT presenter Mike Parry a &#34;d***head&#34; after being compared to a clown in an online poll conducted by show The Two Mikes.
But after a final round one-over 71 left him on the same score for the Open, Beef, whose hair and teeth were also commented on by Parry, said he regretted nothing and would react the same again."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
