If not, here is a little introduction: He is a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/relationship/oh-yeong-sus-married-wife/ rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korean</a> professional footballer renowned for his footballing skills, including his explosive speed and finishing.</p><p>He is the current captain of the South Korean national football team, where he plays forward. Similarly, he has been signed by the Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur since the 2015-16 season. On August 12, 2023, he was named the club’s new captain.</p><p>In his international and club career, Heung-Min has performed exceptionally well and won the hearts of millions worldwide. That said, fans are more than eager to learn if anyone has managed to win the heart of this South Korean.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Son Heung-Min married to a wife?</h2><p>As of this writing, Heung-Min is yet to share the wedding vows with a partner. So, he is unmarried and thus doesn’t have a wife. Similarly, as of now, there are no reports of him dating a girlfriend who might become his wife in the future.</p><p>However, there have been rumors of the footballer planning to get married to South Korean actress Moon Ga-young shortly. These rumors were first <a href=# data-type=link data-id="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/web-series/news/korean/is-true-beauty-star-moon-ga-young-getting-married-to-soccer-sensation-son-heungmin/articleshow/104758858.cms?from=mdr" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">started</a> by an X [formerly called Twitter] user, who stated the two were meeting a wedding planner.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The tweet, which has since been deleted, spread like wildfire. But as the tweet got deleted, many questioned the reliability of the news. Another thing to be noted is that it’s unknown if Ga-young is Heung-Min’s GF, as neither has confirmed they are dating.</p><p>Likewise, some fans remembered what Heung-Min said about getting married a few years ago. During his exclusive <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/son-heung-min-tottenham-spurs-interview-marriage-wait rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with The Guardian</a> in March 2019, Heung-Min delved into what his father, Son Woong-Jung, told him about marriage and that he agrees with his father.</p><p>At the time, he wasn’t dating a girlfriend as well. His father once told him that he should not get married to a wife until he retires as a professional football player. “My father says this and I agree, as well. When you marry, the number one will be family, wife and kids, and then football,” he added.</p><p>As Heung-Min continued, he stated that he wanted to make sure that football would be his number one priority while he still played at the top level. “You don’t know how long you can play at the top level. When you retire, or when you are 33 or 34, you can still have a long life with your family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Son-Heung-Min-rumored-partner-Moon-Ga-young.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">A collage picture of Son Heung-Min and his rumored partner, Moon Ga-young (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>He also mentioned how he has been told that many European managers prefer their players to marry and settle down. He said, “Yeah, because there are many opportunities to do things off the pitch, like drinking or something like that. But I am not the type that likes doing this stuff.”</p><p>“I just want to make sure I make everyone happy by playing at the top level. For example, when I play for Spurs at Wembley, how many Korean flags do you see? I want to keep my level as high as possible for as long as I can to pay back to them. This is very important for me,” Heung-Min concluded.</p><p>To conclude, Heung-Min is yet to get married to a wife, and his present relationship status also seems to be single. He might be following his father’s advice. As for his wedding rumors with Ga-young, nothing can be said until either party officially confirms it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Son Heung-Min’s dating history explored</h2><p>While Heung-Min might not be dating a girlfriend, he was in a few relationships. As per reports, his first relationship dates back to 2014, when he was dating Minah, a member of the popular South Korean girl group Girl’s Day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The news of their togetherness was <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.kpopstarz.com/articles/303338/20211214/girls-day-minah-dating-history-dated-famous-soccer-player-son-heung-min.htm rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first reported</a> in July 2014 by a Korean media outlet named The Fact (formerly known as Sports Seoul). The media outlet also shared pictures from their evening outing on July 16 and July 17, 2014.</p><p>During the outings, they were cautious and weren’t involved in any PDAs. That said, the footballer surprised his then-girlfriend with a bouquet and confessed his feelings toward her.</p><p>This report by The Fact was later confirmed by Girl’s Day’s agency, Dream T Entertainment, who told the same outlet that Heung-Min and Minah were indeed dating and were fans of each other. They also said that their relationship was in the initial stage.</p><p>However, their togetherness didn’t last long because, just three months later, in October 2014, the new couple broke up. Girl’s Day’s agency released a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://omonatheydidnt.livejournal.com/14359590.html rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a> on October 16, where they confirmed the news of their split and the reason why.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Son-Heung-Min-former-GF-Minah.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Son Heung-Min on a date with his now-former GF Minah (Photo: The Fact)</p><p>They stated, “During the time of the dating rumors, they were just starting to have good feelings for each other, but due to the sudden outpour of attention and busy schedules, the two stopped contacting each other.”</p><p>Moreover, Minah also added a statement of her own, where she wrote, “As his fan, I hope that he′ll continue showing great performances in games while I focus on Girl’s Day and individual activities.”</p><p>After his split with Minah, Heung-Min sparked dating speculations with another South Korean star, actress Yoo So-young. The two were rumored to be dating for a long time, and the footballer finally confirmed it in November 2015.</p><p>However, their relationship lasted for less than a year as they broke up in 2016. It has been <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/son-heung-min-girlfriend rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that Heung-Min follows his parents’ wishes and that his father wasn’t fond of him dating and wanted him to focus on his career. And that’s why he and So-young split.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Son-Heung-Min-former-GF-Yoo-So-young.png><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Son Heung-Min taking a selfie with his now-former GF Yoo So-young (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>At the time of their relationship, not much was known, such as how they met and more. But it was later cleared by the actress when she briefly <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/news-he-asked-me-you-know-me-when-k-pop-star-yoo-so-young-startled-ex-boyfriend-son-heung-min-first-meeting rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">opened up</a> about her relationship with the footballer on the podcast Jung Young Jin and Choi Wook’s Fiery Friday Night Show.</p><p>On the podcast, So-young mentioned that she wasn’t aware of Heung-Min and his popularity as a footballer when she first met him. She stated, “Yes! I like watching soccer but I don’t know which player is who. This is the first time I’m revealing this but I didn’t know who he was at first.”</p><p>She then recalled one of her first conversations with Heung-Min. She said, “‘I’m sorry. I only know about Ahn Jung Hwan.’ He seemed very startled. He asked me, ‘You don’t know me?’ My friend spoke up for me and explained that I really don’t know who he is.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>“I was having a meal with my peers, and I got to meet him while I was with them. We didn’t meet at a club,” So-young stated when asked how she met Heung-Min.</p><p>Since his split with his second girlfriend, Heung-Min hasn’t been in any confirmed relationships. In 2019, he was rumored to be dating <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/blackpink/ rel="noreferrer noopener">BLACKPINK</a>‘s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://glamourbuff.com/tag/jisoo/ rel="noreferrer noopener">Jisoo</a>, but whenever these rumors popped up, BLACKPINK’s agency, YG Entertainment, continued to deny them.</p><p>The agency’s <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/celebrity/article/3152214/blackpinks-jisoo-dating-footballer-son-heung-min-dating rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official statement</a> on the rumors was, “We would like to clarify that all the dating rumours related to Blackpink’s Jisoo are not true. We have been aware of the rumours circulating.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Son-Heung-Min-rumored-girlfriend-Jisoo.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">A collage picture of Son Heung-Min with his rumored girlfriend Jisoo (Photo: Instagram)</p><p>“Considering that it has become widespread among international fans as well, we now believe the situation calls for an official statement. Please stop the unreasonable spread of false rumors,” they added.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2022, Heung-Min was linked to another South Korean actress, Kim Go-eun. But the actress’s agency came forward to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.soompi.com/article/1559380wpp/kim-go-euns-agency-firmly-denies-actresss-dating-rumors-with-soccer-player-son-heung-min rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deny</a> the dating rumors and added that Heung-Min and Go-eun have never met each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570qmmq6yjZMCwuoyhnK6ml2K6qrqMnZitoZ6ceqi10aWdq6GVo7Fuw8ifnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sam-smith-music-video-controversy.html><span>←</span><span>Sam Smith's Music Video Controversy, Explained</span></a>
