The Grammy-winning artist was definitely feeling heated on Oct. 27, taking to Instagram to vent his frustrations over a troubled relationship. Sharing a sexy pic of himself on stage, he wrote, “B*tch playing games when she know you the hottest n***a on the planet!” Yikes.&nbsp;Fans were obviously dying to know who the angry post was about, but of course many speculated that it had something to do with&nbsp;his most recent fling <strong>Cydney Christine</strong>. Furthermore, this was only the beginning of his emotional&nbsp;rant.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/BMFZPhgF60t/?taken-by=chrisbrownofficial</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Chris continued to comment on the touchy subject in another post, writing, “We cheat on our girlfriends, but we don’t want them to cheat on us…We cheat for sex, just to f**k, but when a woman cheats, she cheats for love and affection. She cheats with a guy that can potentially replace you. We cheat the most, but women cheat the best.” Woah! So, is there already <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>trouble in paradise</a> with Chris and Cydney? The two recently went to&nbsp;Hollywood Horror Nights on Oct. 20, seeming to have a blast. Nonetheless, he&nbsp;finished his sentiments, “Women are not afraid to love, commit and be loyal, but the problem sometimes is with us men.”</p><h3>Chris Brown In Crisis — Check Out All Of The Shocking Pics!</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Cydney may have also commented on their&nbsp;fizzled romance via Twitter, but it’s hard to confirm if the unverified account is hers. The post reads, “Guys .. if you don’t want a girl, TELL HER.” Others were quick to question whether or not his message was directed towards <strong>Karrueche Tran</strong>.&nbsp;Even though she and Chris both attended the&nbsp;Maxim Halloween party in LA&nbsp;on Oct. 22, Kae&nbsp;told us&nbsp;EXCLUSIVELY that they “haven’t spoken in a while.” Another possible option: this could be&nbsp;a response to&nbsp;<strong>Rihanna</strong>‘s cryptic post about relationships.&nbsp;So tricky! Hopefully this all gets settled soon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do YOU think Chris’ heartfelt post is about Cydney?
