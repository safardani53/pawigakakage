But The Crowded Room, it’s 10 months of playing this character, day in and day out. I really did find myself kind of morphing with him in certain moments. And obviously I had that crazy hairstyle,” Holland, 27, told <a href=#>Radio Times</a> in an interview published earlier this month. “I had the bangs. Bless Zendaya, she had a lot to put up with, with me looking like that for 10 months, it was rough.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Spider-Man: Homecoming star noted that it wasn’t just the<a href=#> Euphoria </a>actress, 26 — whom he’s been dating since 2021 — that had to deal with his coif. He wasn’t a fan of his hair being “that dark” himself — the tresses are a deep chestnut brown in the AppleTV+ series — and much prefers his hair more “like my mom’s, kind of red.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Yeah, it was tough.

Unlikely investigator Rya (<a href=#><strong>Amanda Seyfriend</strong></a>) must solve the mystery behind it before the true criminal strikes again. As Danny’s life story unfolds, it reveals “elements of the mysterious past that shaped him, and the twists and turns that will lead him to a life-altering revelation,” per the official synopsis.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The heavy material is something that Holland — who is also an executive producer on the series — <a href=#>found it hard to break away from when stepping off-set</a>. “I would come home from work and I would see myself in the mirror and I would see him,” he told the outlet. “So it did take a while to figure out how to put him to bed and wake Tom up and get on with my life and be myself. But I figured it out and was very happy and healthy.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Holland is “no stranger to hard work,” the England native revealed earlier this month that he is pressing pause on acting as he recuperates from the intense emotional toll The Crowded Room took on him.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“The show did break me. There did come a time where <a href=#>I needed a break and disappeared</a> and went to Mexico for a week and had time on a beach and laid low. I’m now taking a year off, and that is a result of how difficult this show was. I am excited to see how it turns out,” he told<a href=#> Extra</a> in a Wednesday, June 7, interview. “I feel like our hard work wasn’t in vain.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Cherry actor’s recent vacation was seemingly alongside longtime love Zendaya. When Holland turned 27 earlier this month, the Shake It Up alum <a href=#>took to social media to celebrate his birthday</a> — and shared photos of the twosome on their romantic getaway.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>In one photo, Holland could be seen swimming in the ocean. Zendaya added a red heart emoji to the picture in between Holland’s hands which made a heart above his head. The second snap saw the British actor standing on a rocky cliff with the sun setting on the ocean behind him. Zendaya captioned the moment with a heart eyes emoji and tagged Holland in the post.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Holland and Zendaya first met in 2016 while working on Spider-Man: Homecoming.
