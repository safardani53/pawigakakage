In one of her photos, seen in the fourth slide of<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> the below carousel</a>, Ruth appeared to have a growing baby bump as she smiled in a yellow dress with an unbuttoned black and white short-sleeve button-down worn over it.&nbsp; She didn’t appear to be trying to hide the bulge in the photo, but certainly didn’t show it off, either. Fans immediately began congratulating her, despite her not making any announcement.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Since then, Ruth has only posted a few times on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and given no further glimpse of her belly. She last shared a photo of herself on June 4 (seen below), and the photo sliced her toso in half diagonally. An argument could be made that she was rocking a baby bump, but she once again in no way tried to put it front and center.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>White Lotus</a> star and Ruth <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed their first child</a> together, a baby girl, in Aug. 2021. They are fiercely protective over their relationship and private life, so&nbsp; very little is known about their firstborn. James, however, opened up about fatherhood during a 2022 chat with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>InStyle</a>. “It’s discombobulating at first,” he admitted. “Especially with your first child because your whole life changes, but ultimately it makes you — definitely for me, at least — a much more solid person.” Their daughter could be seen being carried by Theo in the Palm Springs carousel seen above.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The couple began dating as students at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, England in 2009, according to Glamour UK (via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bustle</a>). They walked down the aisle in 2018 and even starred in a few episodes of Sanditon in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5JpZq2glaR6q63Mnqpmr5mbsm680Z6ep5meqXq0scKopZ1lk522rbCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pressure-cooker-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>Everything About Netflixs 2023 Show Pressure Cooker</span></a>
