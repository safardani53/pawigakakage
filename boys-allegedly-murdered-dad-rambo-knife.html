he was about to turn 31 years old.</p><p>"This is a case about how these young men arrived at his door and mercilessly cut him down.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in UK News</h2></p><p>"At around 11pm three young men arrived at his door and within an astonishingly short amount of time, he was lying just inside his own front door bleeding to death from numerous stab wounds.</p><p>"By the time emergency services arrived it was too late and at just after midnight, he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>"The defendants' subsequent behaviour seems to suggest they may have enjoyed and revelled in the powers of ruthlessness that appear to have possessed them.</p><p>"Their girlfriends, or friends, tried to help them get away from the area and hide incriminating evidence."</p><p>Ms Jones continued: "The crown say that the speed and ferocity of the attack meant the three knew what was going to happen and the the part they were about to play.</p><p>"Mr Olah obviously cannot tell us what happened, but his partner, [Ms Lee], will do her best."</p><p>The court heard how Chelsea was watching TV before there was a bang at the door.</p><p>She said her partner went to the door before hearing another bang and Frantisek "shouting out in pain".</p><p>"She came through to the hallway and saw him lying on the floor with one of the men already in and two right behind," Ms Jones added.</p><h2>'RAMBO KNIFE'</h2><p>Chelsea described the first intruder, who she knew to be Carty, to be carrying a knife and described it as "a Rambo knife".</p><p>Ms Jones continued: "She heard [Carty] say something about giving them the keys - but in fact the car wasn't taken.</p><p>"[Carty] was stabbing into the upper part of his body and Mr Kamarra-Jarra, he too was stabbing and then the third.</p><p>"They were all stabbing, repeatedly and at speed - she thinks they stabbed him about 20 times before she shouted at Mr Carty who came towards her."</p><p>Chelsea then retreated into the garden to get help from a neighbour, shouting "there's people in my house with knives".</p><p>The three teenagers then made a dash "running off down the road".</p><p>Going back into her home, Chelsea explained her partner was lying in so much blood "it was hard to approach".</p><p>One neighbour told police one of the attackers "appeared to laugh" as they fled.</p><h2>'CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE'</h2><p>In details from Frantisek's post-mortem, "catastrophic damage" was caused with one stab wound penetrating 12cm hitting his lung - his death was described as "inevitable".</p><p>Jurors heard after the attack there were a series of calls between the men and young women.</p><p>In CCTV footage shown, various images showed the cars of Byrne and Saunders driving to and from various locations with the attackers.</p><p>Ms Jones added Byrne and Saunders were together and "waiting to be called" to assist the men and "ferry them around".</p><p>"What can have been so important it needed all those meetings and phone calls in the early hours of the morning?," Ms Jones said.</p><p>A taxi driver is also said to have overheard Mills - in response to the cordoned off crime scene - saying "I'm actually scared now" before being told to "shut up" because of their environment.</p><p>Ms Jones said: "The crown suggests that this is Abbie Mills investigating the actions of her boyfriend.</p><p>"What then transpires is that the men scatter."</p><p>The court heard that Byrne drove Carty and Kamarra-Jarra to Oxford, describing the situation as "hiding out".</p><p>Ms Jones said Kamarra-Jarra had a friend in Oxford, who said of their exchange: "He said he was in hiding and killed someone because he raised the price of drugs and was being mean to them."</p><p>It is understood Kamarra-Jarra told the friend they "hadn't meant" to kill Frantisek - but told how he stabbed him in the back and "twisted the knife".</p><p>Kamarra-Jarra and Carty were later arrested while Daley was arrested in Southampton.</p><p>All three boys from Basingstoke deny the murder.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Byrne, Saunders and Mills, also from Basingstoke, deny assisting an offender.</p><p>The trial - which is expected to last eight weeks - continues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/0b4b5183-0adc-4340-a82c-fba0efa3f049.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ310fpZram1nkqTGtHnApaOen5WZubp5zK6pnZ2imrFusMCdZKuZnZe8brfNop2eZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./porsha-williams-wore-7-bridal-gowns-for-wedding-to-simon-guobadia.html><span>←</span><span>Porsha Williams Shares the Details Behind Her 7 Wedding Gowns</span></a>
