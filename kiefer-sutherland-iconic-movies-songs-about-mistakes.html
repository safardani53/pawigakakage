“Before my first shows I was thinking people would want to kill me,” says Sutherland, 56.
“But people have been so incredibly generous with me and it had a very profound effect on me."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

And it became really, really important.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON KIEFER SUTHERLAND">READ MORE ON KIEFER SUTHERLAND</h2><p>“So that allowed me to feel much more comfortable about talking about some of the dumber things that I’ve done in my life and some of the mistakes I’ve made.</p><p>“I don’t think anyone in the audience has had a perfect run in their lives. Like me, we are all doing the best we can and maybe we need to help each other a little more.</p><p>“That’s the feeling I get from a show — so they’re fun and really important to me.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Inspired by his first heartbreak</h2><p>Sutherland begins his UK tour next week after postponing his European tour last year after contracting <a href=#>Covid</a>.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><p>He says: “I’m thrilled to be coming back to make those shows up. And there are added shows that we’re doing on this tour.</p><p>Sutherland is chatting on video call from Savannah, Georgia, where he is filming <a href=#>Clint Eastwood’s upcoming film Juror #2, slated to be the director’s final movie</a>.</p><p>He says: “It’s unbelievably hot here. Hot and humid but I’m just finishing filming.”</p><p>&nbsp;He adds: “When I started playing live, the music started informing my acting.</p><p>“I’m an actor, and have worked professionally for over 30 years and so thought that was going to help me with the musical stage.</p><p>“But it’s been the opposite.</p><p>“With acting, they are always going to be a character because they’re not my words, and I didn’t write them.</p><p>“In my songs I create characters that are closer to me as a person and the exchange between myself and an audience on a music tour has allowed me to feel comfortable.”</p><p>Sutherland’s latest album, the <a href=#>country-flavoured Bloor Street</a>, gave him another hit in the UK when it was released last January.</p><p>This followed the success of his second album, Reckless & Me, which reached No9 in 2019 and firmly established him as a singer songwriter in his own right.</p><p>He says: “I love acting so much and it’s still what I do — I do both things.</p><p>“And it’s completely fine if someone likes my work as an actor and that’s all they want.</p><p>“That’s completely cool.”</p><p>Song Going Down, one of the standouts on Bloor Street, was the first track he wrote for it — and it was inspired by his first heartbreak.</p><p>He says: “It was the first gut punch I got from these songs.</p><p>“It’s a style of writing where I will try and tell a story that really is very specific. It’s not a metaphor.</p><p>“Even with a song like County Jail Gate, <a href=#>that song became my experience of when I went to jail [for drink driving]</a>.</p><p>“I’ve made some mistakes in life.</p><p>“That song started because I was watching a movie and at the opening of the film, a guy was getting out of prison.</p><p>“The credit sequence was the prison gate opening — a sound I have heard for real.</p><p>“The sound of the County Jail Gate is a sound you’ll never mistake and that became the line of the song.</p><p>“Invariably, you’re going to write a lot about the things that were hardest.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘Stand By Me really got the ball rolling’</h2><p>“No one was more embarrassed than I was about what I had done and the situation I put myself in.</p><p>“Writing about it was helpful because until you can forgive yourself you can’t move forward.</p><p>“Writing for me has been very cathartic in that way.”</p><p>Bloor Street was the street Sutherland grew up on in Toronto, Canada, where music was an important part of his life.</p><p>He says: “Music and girls were very important thing for me back then. My life revolved around that.</p><p>“I started the guitar early. And then acting took over my life by the time I was 15.</p><p>“I made a small film in Canada called The Bay Boy and I’d done a couple of plays in Toronto and everything started moving forward.</p><p>“I got very lucky and I was at the perfect place at the perfect time.</p><p>“It was <a href=#>Stand By Me</a> [1986] that really got the ball rolling and the ball picked up a lot of speed with The Lost Boys [1987].</p><p>“I had a child on the way so all I cared about was getting the next job, which was Young Guns and then Flatliners, which was a big hit.”</p><p>He adds: “You have really no idea which film is going to be successful or which film is going to considered iconic.</p><p>“When we were making Lost Boys, we had no idea. We just wanted it to be good enough to get another job. It certainly did that for us.</p><p>“But the reference point for me will always be Stand By Me because it was the first film that I did where I was like, ‘Oh, so this is what it’s like at the top’.</p><p>“It’s such a beautiful story.</p><p>“Each generation has its own version of what the growing up experience is.</p><p>“I certainly loved mine and being able to be a part of the one that Stephen King was describing in the book (The Body).</p><p>“Making that film was a really special time.</p><p>“I was so lucky to work with a director like Rob Reiner, and all of those actors on that film. And the same for TV shows like 24 and <a href=#>Designated Survivor</a>.</p><p>“When 24 started, people were coming up to me in the street calling me Jack Bauer.</p><p>“I was thrilled that people were enjoying it so much.</p><p>“If it meant people were going to call me by a different name, I didn’t mind.”</p><p>And it was the storytelling side of country music that made him fall in love with the genre.</p><p>“I can listen to a <a href=#>Zeppelin </a>or a <a href=#>David Bowie</a> song and there’s a lot left for interpretation,” he says.</p><p>“But when I listen to Johnny Cash singing A Boy Named Sue, there’s no confusing what that’s about.</p><p>“It’s a story and has a beginning, middle and an end. That’s what I love about films.</p><p>“And that’s what I like about writing songs, so I really leaned into that genre of music.</p><p>“I realised I could tell stories and not be restricted to the melodies of American country music, so each album has been a little freer.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘Songs are all about tempo and feel’</h2><p>“And like anybody else, I’m learning as I go. I’ve become more comfortable as a singer, which has increased the options that I find for melody.</p><p>“So hopefully every album is a progression.”</p><p>Playing live, Sutherland has one goal — to make sure the crowd are dancing.</p><p>He says: “I want to play a set that would make you move.</p><p>“There’s a couple of slower songs in there but pretty much everything else is moving.</p><p>“It’s not a rock set but you’re going to dance.</p><p>“I want the show to feel like a freight train moving along.</p><p>“It’s taken three albums to be able to pick and choose songs from all three records to have a set that’s going to really drive.</p><p>“And it’s so much fun to play because it’s really energetic.</p><p>“I didn’t pick songs because of their meaning, it’s all about tempo and feel.”</p><p>But can he choose between music and acting?</p><p>He says: “This is the thing, I love them both so much.</p><p>“And they both present very different, and yet somehow connected, challenges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d382d859-0da2-49e0-a1a0-b3dea1038c38.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kiefer-sutherland-lost-boys-tv-277992771.jpg><p>“They both frustrate me but they also give me the greatest joy and the greatest sense of accomplishment.</p><p>“There are other things I can do.</p><p>“I cook a meal, I can do a bunch of things, but playing a really good show, there’s a high off &nbsp;that, that’s hard to beat.</p><p>“And it’s the same thing with making a film, especially if you’ve got a team that has a lot of expectation, because it makes everything else work.</p><p>“If you get that right, you feel pretty good about what you are doing.</p><p>“So, I love them both so much.</p><p>“And you know, if you do something you love, you won’t work a day in your life.</p><p>“So next week, I’m very excited to be playing in the UK again.</p><p>“We didn’t get to finish the last tour because of Covid.</p><p>“But the shows I had played, I certainly got a reaction that our show had evolved.</p><p>“So I was very excited by that.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>“I’m ready to pick up from there and go again.”</p><ul><li>Kiefer Sutherland plays Norwich Waterfront July 17; Bournemouth O2 Academy, July 18; Brighton Chalk, July 19; London PowerHaus, July 21; Coventry HMV Empire, July 22; Manchester Ritz, July 25; and Edinburgh Queens Hall, July 26.
