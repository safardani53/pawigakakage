Fans of the sport watched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cody Gakpo</a> defeat multiple teams while representing the Netherlands. At just 23, Cody has proved he’s not playing around, as he’s been the one to watch at the <a href=#>2022 Fifa World Cup</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since entering the World Cup in November, Cody has scored three goals during the first three nights and doesn’t plan to slow down until he wins the competitive championship. Before the World Cup, Cody had an impressive résumé as a winger for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eredivisie club PSV</a> and the Netherlands national team. He’s also earned several awards, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dutch Footballer of the Year </a>for the 2021-2022 season, after being responsible for most of his team’s goals.</p><p>Although he’s a bona fide soccer superstar, Cody seems to stay grounded. He likely has his two parents and siblings to thank for his humble nature. Here’s what we learned about Cody Gakpo’s parents and how they support him from the sidelines.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cody Gakpo’s parents raised their son in the Netherlands but have different ethnicities.</h2><p>Cody was born on May 7, 1999, in Eindhoven, Netherlands. He was born to parents <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny and Ank Gakpo</a>, who raised him and his two brothers in the district of Stratum, just 2.3 km away from Eindhoven.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>, Cody isn’t the only athlete in his family. Ank played rugby for the Netherlands in her younger years, which is likely how Cody found his competitive drive. While neither Ank nor Johnny is a professional athlete today, they prioritize their son’s bustling sports career and have been right next to him during his crucial career highlights.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In December 2020, Cody posted photos of him alongside his parents on Instagram. Johnny and Ank posed next to their son as he celebrated signing a five-year contract with PSV. Their unwavering support is something Cody’s former coach <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twan Scheepers</a> said allows the athlete to stay on the right track on and off the field.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"His parents are very solid, don't do stupid things — the parents, family, friends, and Cody and his brothers, they did a great job in not pushing him too much," Scheepers explained to ESPN in November 2022. "They wanted to show that life is good. They are a religious family. I think that's important and a big thing in the world, he's quite relaxed. The only thing that matters to him is playing the game, and nothing bothers him around it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Cody Gakpo’s ethnicity?</h2><p>Growing up, Cody was able to navigate multiple cultures due to his ethnicity. Reportedly his father is originally from Togo, a country in <a href=#>West Africa</a>, and has Ghanaian ancestry, while Ank is Dutch.</p><p>While Cody doesn’t shy away from his ethnicity, he’s proud to represent the Netherlands through sports. In his home country, he’s received support from many fans and comparisons to another famous Netherlands-born athlete, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robin van Persie</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>When asked about the comparisons, Cody embraced the honor and said he’s only focused on improving his skills in the coming years.</p><p>“He’s a legendary player in the Netherlands and in the whole world,” Cody said of Robin while speaking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FIFA+</a>. “It’s an honour for me to be compared to him, but at the end of the day, I’m my own player. I have to prove myself and do my best.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLylxYygmKSon2K9or7Ep6us</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-goldman-srebnick-on-wynwood-walls-miami-art-week.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Goldman Srebnick on Wynwood Walls, Miami Art Week</span></a>
