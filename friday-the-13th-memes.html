We never thought we’d see the day when the most haunted date of the year would take place in the most haunted month, but in 2023, it’s finally happening. Friday, October 13, 2023, is taking the world by storm (a very scary storm) as we figure out how to celebrate this <a href=#>pre-Halloween holiday</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As always, one of the best ways to celebrate is through humor and memes.

It's also a campy and terrifying horror film called Friday the 13th (which takes place at camp). And in the film, the teens go swimming, have sex, smoke, get drunk, go out, split up, run from the killer, trip, and forget to turn the lights on! So just keep calm.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Trees love Friday the 13th!</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Mark Parisi's silly Friday the 13th comic has become one of the holiday's best memes.
