He loves to play with her for five minutes, and then he’s kind of over it. But he’s a good big brother. He helps her a lot, which is nice.”</p><p>The couple’s youngest is reaching many new milestones, she added. “She’s sitting up now, which is really nice when she wants to. She’s kind of a princess. She’s like, ‘I’d rather have somebody hold me up.’ But she’s talking a lot, babbling, loves her brother. She’s moving everywhere. You can’t put her down anymore.”</p><p>As for their toddler, Jackson is “pretty good” behavior-wise, but “asks the same question over and over again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Little People, Big World airs on TLC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatp6KeerutwqFkq6ecpLOnecCrnGamn6l6sLqMrZ%2BeZaOWuqZ5z5qenmWRl7y2wIxsqZ1lkpavur%2BMraCmoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./schuyler-fisk.html><span>←</span><span>Schuyler Fisk</span></a>
