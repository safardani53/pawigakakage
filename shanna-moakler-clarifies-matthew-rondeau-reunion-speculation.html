If you have nothing nice to say, go away. He is kind, he is loving he is talented and he is loved.”</p><p>While speaking to Us, Moakler added: “Relationships can be difficult when played out in the public eye, but love is love and I love him, and I know the people who know us will support us.”</p><p>In February, Rondeau made headlines when <a href=#>he posted an expletive-laden video</a> on Moakler’s Instagram account. “I’m done. I’m never talking to this f—king specimen of a f—king human again,” he said in the since-deleted clip. “The truth is I found out that she was talking to other f—king people the whole entire time in our relationship, that’s the truth: That’s the whole f—king truth and I didn’t say a goddamn f—king thing.”</p><p>Shortly after the video was posted, the Murder Party star was <a href=#>arrested for felony domestic violence</a>. He was later released on $50,000 bail.</p><p>Two weeks later, <a href=#>the duo were spotted together</a> in Rhode Island, but Moakler later told Us that <a href=#>they weren’t back together</a>.</p><p>“Matthew and I are not together. However, we’re remaining cordial,” she said in April. “I think he and I have a very deep love for one another. I love him very, very much. He’s someone that I was with for two years and, you know, obviously, we had a very public incident, which was embarrassing for both of us. It’s not something either one of us are proud of.”</p><p>At the time, the former Playboy model said she understood why some observers were “triggered” by the pair’s on-again, off-again romance.</p><p>“I know people who have been in relationships where there’s been any form of abuse, whether it’s mental, verbal, emotionally, it’s very, very triggering,” the <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother</a> alum told Us. “I’m a mother and I want my children, and especially my daughters, to see me as a strong woman who has self-respect and self-esteem, and I want my son to see that as well.”</p><p>The Rhode Island native shares son Landon, 18, and daughter Alabama, 16, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a>, whom she divorced in 2008. She also shares daughter Atiana, 23, with ex <strong>Oscar De La Hoya</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Rondeau’s Instagram outburst, Alabama took to social media to let fans know <a href=#>she’d checked on her mom</a> — and shared some choice words for Moakler’s boyfriend. “I’m not sure what happened on her [Instagram] Live I’m in contact with her and she is okay,” Alabama wrote via Instagram in February. “That man needs serious help!”</p><p>With reporting by Diana Cooper</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGju6J5zKiYpKSVp3qkuMCroJ%2Bhlah6rq3TrZ%2Ber12nvK%2BwxJqsZqqVqruqu81mqqmdk6q5osDIqKVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-chrisley-levi-denim-chase-martin-music-video.html><span>←</span><span>Savannah Chrisley Flaunts Her 'Levi Denim' in New Music Video</span></a>
