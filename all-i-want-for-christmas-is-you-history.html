It is, bar none, the most enduring modern Christmas “standard” of our time, and I personally guarantee you’re hearing it in your head right now. That is its power.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff was one of Carey’s trusted collaborators in 1994. He’d previously worked with her on “Love Takes Time,” Emotions and Music Box, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>recalled to Billboard in 2014</a> that work on Carey’s Christmas album initially started in 1993.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Twenty years ago,” he said in 2014, “Christmas music and Christmas albums by artists weren’t the big deal that they are today … The first song we wrote was ‘Miss You Most (At Christmas Time).’ It was a ballad-y, sort of sad song. And then we wrote a classical, sort of religious song called ‘Jesus Born on This Day.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Then,” Afanasieff recalled, “we started to write what Mariah wanted to do and what Tommy [Mottola, the CEO of Sony and Carey’s then-husband] wanted to do which was a Phil Spector, old rock ‘n’ roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff is referring to A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector, a 1963 album that saw Spector apply his trademark “Wall of Sound” production to a collection of Christmas standards performed by his roster of artists, including The Ronettes, The Crystals and Darlene Love. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Brian Wilson called it his favorite album of all time</a>, and several of its cuts (“Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” and “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” among them) became iconic Christmas songs — original pressings of the record (a failure at the time) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>now sell for up to $300</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m a very festive person and I love the holidays. I’ve sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Carey said at the time</a>. “I wrote it just out of love for Christmas and like really loving Christmas music,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>she added in 2015</a>. But it was Carey’s knowledge of music history that made the song’s unique mix of elements work. “I listen to a lot of old R&B and I listen to a lot of gospel music for inspiration,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>she said in 1994</a>. “I also listen to the radio, and I know every song on the radio because I’m a fanatic about that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I stared playing some rock ‘n’ roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand,” Afanasieff recalled. Carey joined in with the first line, “I don’t want a lot for Christmas,” and the song was off to the races. Initially, Carey’s melody faced some resistance from her co-writer, though: “My first reaction was, ‘That sounds like someone doing voice scales,’ ” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Afanasieff told Business Insider in 2013</a>. “‘Are you sure that’s what you want?'”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Time & Life Pictures/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carey persisted, and the work continued for a few hours. “She would sing a melody and I would do a chord change,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he continued to BI</a>. “It was almost like a game of ping-pong, back and forth, until we had it.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That one went very quickly,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he explained to Billboard</a>. “It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic; not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don’t hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff is underselling his own work. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Writing at Slate, Adam Ragusea undertook</a> an extensive analysis of the harmony behind “All I Want for Christmas,” counting at least 13 distinct chords in the song, including a minor subdominant chord, which is also found — crucially — in Irving Berlin’s “White Christmas.” In short, “All I Want” is, despite its presumed simplicity, a relatively sophisticated piece of pop songwriting that has more in common with the Great American Songbook than it does with any of its peers on the charts in 1994. “It’s very retro, kind of like Sixties,” Carey said in 1994.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff and Carey tinkered away with the music and lyrics until the summer of 1994. After first attempting to record the song in California with a live band, Afanasieff took matters into his own hands, programming every aspect of the song except for the vocals by himself with a keyboard. But, he said, when it came time to record Carey’s main vocal in New York, “that’s when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Carey also reportedly brought in</a> Christmas lights and trees in the studio to set the mood while she sang.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff had no idea the pair had dusted a hit. In fact, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he remembered to ASCAP in 2014</a> that he initially disliked the song, with its schmaltzy chords and vocal melody that recalled “a practice interval” used by singers and musicians to warm up. But “Keeping that [chordal] tradition — and then the oversimplified melody — I guess because it was that, made it so easily palatable for the whole world to go, ‘Oh. Yeah, I can’t get that out of my head.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff wasn’t alone in his mistrust of the setup. In his book Hitmaker: The Man and His Music, Tommy Mottola — who was the then-24-year-old Carey’s husband (he has a cameo as Santa in the song’s video) — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>remembered his wife’s resistance</a> to the cover art to the Christmas album. “What are you trying to do, turn me into Connie Francis?” Carey reportedly told him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s a Christmas song, but it has no religious content,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Andrea Dresdale of ABC News Radio told Vogue</a> of “All I Want”‘s eternal popularity in 2015. “In reality, it’s just a love song. Everybody understands longing, desire, love, or just missing somebody. It’s an upbeat song. So many Christmas songs are not. Many of them are ballads, some of them are depressing, but this one sounds like a party.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff and Carey parted ways after Carey’s 1997 album Butterfly, but he remains philosophical about his song’s success — reinvigorated around its 20th birthday by pivotal placement in 2003’s equally iconic Love, Actually.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s not like no one writes Christmas songs — everyone is trying to get a Christmas song,” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>he told Billboard</a>. “But for whatever reason ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ just became that song. It’s kind of something you never would have thought, and you can’t really explain why, and we feel lucky, because it was the last major song to enter that Christmas canon, and then the door slammed shut.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Afanasieff also gave BI one last piece of advice about the song: “The last thing I would tell a record company is to make another ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Oh, and if you needed any more evidence of “All I Want”‘s appeal, it literally seems to work on an interspecies level. In 2010, a British goat farmer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>found out that his goats produced more milk</a> when played a loop of Carey’s hit. Apparently “The Chipmunk Song” had the opposite effect, so consider those two the yin and yang of “Christmas songs that promote goat milk production,” if that’s a category anyone’s keeping track of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The fact that [Mariah] was able to write a song that broke through and became the modern Christmas classic proved what a talented songwriter she is,” Dresdale added. “It also allowed her to brand herself as the Queen of Christmas. She’s turned Christmas into a cottage industry. This song really was one of the greatest things that ever happened to Mariah Carey.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well, Carey and the world at large. Her and Afanasieff’s creation is, literally, after more than 25 years, all we want, whether we know it or not.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52qwKqvjpqjpWWZYsSiutNmnaiqXZi1s7XSraSaq12ewG7Fzq5koaGjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./when-are-the-brood-x-insects-coming.html><span>←</span><span>Cicadas 2021 map: Where are the Brood X insects now?</span></a>
