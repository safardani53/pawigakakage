He then pointed out that O’Brien, 32, and producer <strong>Tommy Alter</strong> were both in the audience. Cameras switched to O’Brien <a href=# rel=noopener>who did a thumbs up for viewers</a> while sipping a drink.</p><p>“I want to welcome our friends Dylan O’Brien and Tommy Alter to the Clubhouse. Great to see you! Dylan being a huge <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> fan, I found out tonight. I love it,” Cohen, 55, said as the audience cheered.</p><p>O’Brien was not mentioned again, but <a href=#>he did get fans talking about the unexpected cameo</a>. “This feels random. Dylan O’Brien is in the #WWHL audience tonight!” a social media commentator wrote via X.</p><p>Meanwhile, another viewer poked fun at O’Brien enjoying himself in New York City, writing, “Just dylan o’brien in his natural state (sipping on his drink) in the audience of wwhl tonight.”</p><p>O’Brien was photographed hours prior <a href=#>showing his support for the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike</a> on the picket line. He wore a hoodie that referenced the actors’ union, which he paired with green sweatpants and a red baseball hat.</p><p>The actor rose to stardom after <a href=#>playing fan-favorite character Stiles Stilinski on MTV’s hit series</a> Teen Wolf from 2011 to 2017. O’Brien went on to score the role of Thomas in the Maze Runner film franchise. He has since also appeared in movies including Deepwater Horizon, American Assassin, Bumblebee, Love and Monsters and Not Okay.</p><p>O’Brien’s collaborations with <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, however, have been <a href=#>our favorite part of his filmography</a> so far. In 2021, O’Brien starred opposite <a href=#><strong>Sadie Sink</strong></a> in Swift’s <a href=#>short film All Too Well</a>. He was also credited as a drummer on Swift’s song “Snow on the Beach,” <a href=#>which was featured on her 2022 album Midnights.</a></p><p>After All Too Well scored <a href=#>five nominations at the MTV Video Music Awards, O’Brien praised</a> Swift, 33, as an artist.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She sent us the news first thing in the morning,” he told Entertainment Tonight in July 2022. “She’s genuinely just someone who’s so involved and just proud of her work and is so grateful for any accomplishment or recognition for something that she just poured herself into. Talk about a special human.”</p><p>According to O’Brien, <a href=#>he has been in a “group chat” with Swift and Sink</a>, 21, since working on the music video together. “[Taylor] would make a really, really good director. If it’s something that her heart’s in, Taylor can do whatever she wants,” he added. “She could easily direct a feature and it’d be something I’d sign up for, for sure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuypJGjerCu0aKcp2Wdlrimv4ysrKuoop7ApnnAqaeemaKWu6SxjKKlZqyYmnqiwcOinKeblWK8p3nWsJ%2BlZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brie-larson-plastic-surgery-html.html><span>←</span><span>Brie Larson's Glow Up Is It Natural Beauty or Plastic Surgery?</span></a>
