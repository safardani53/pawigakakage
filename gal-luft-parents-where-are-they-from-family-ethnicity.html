Family &amp;amp; Ethnicity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Gal Luft’s family</strong> sparked renewed attention when an Israeli scholar indicated that he submitted evidence to the FBI of Biden’s family’s wrongdoing. Along with disseminating information on Biden’s family, Luft has been charged with weapons trafficking and violating Iranian sanctions.</p><p>The accusations against Gal Luft, a dual Israeli-US citizen, were made public on Monday, and he was charged by the Department of Justice (DOJ). He is charged with eight counts of illicit activity on behalf of China and selling Iranian oil. Luft, 57, was detained on February 17 in Cyprus but was freed on bail and has since eluded investigators.&nbsp;He claims the criminal prosecution is an effort to keep him from testifying regarding purported payments made to the Bidens by persons linked with Chinese military intelligence.</p><h2>Where Did the Gal Luft Parents Come From?</h2><p><strong>Gal Luft,</strong> an Israeli academic who claims he gave the FBI proof of corruption inside the Biden family, is suddenly in the spotlight. Following this announcement, people are curious to discover more about his family and where they are from. However, the dual US-Israeli citizen has not revealed any information.&nbsp;According to the indictment, Luft, a co-director of a Maryland-based research group, has long been engaged in different international criminal enterprises.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gal-Luft-1.jpg alt="Gal Luft" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused Luft of weapons trafficking and breaching Iranian sanctions. His other allegations include covertly working for China and seeking to organize weapons sales with Libya, Kenya, and the UAE without required US permissions.&nbsp;Furthermore, Luft has been accused of supplying Iranian oil to China in breach of sanctions.&nbsp;Luft left while on bail when being held in Cyprus, and his present whereabouts are unknown. The indictment against him was made public on Monday.</p><h2>More Information On The Gal Luft Family: Ethnicity And Origin</h2><p>As previously stated, Gal Luft, the guy who has faced the load of several criminal allegations, has not revealed any facts about his origins.&nbsp;Nonetheless, he had some origins in Israel and eventually relocated to the United States. Prosecutors in Manhattan announced the accusations against Luft on Monday, which were brought earlier this year.&nbsp;According to the indictment, Luft and his associates were involved in several criminal enterprises across the world.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gal-Luft-2.jpg alt="Gal Luft" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Luft claims that he knows the Biden family’s ties with people linked with Chinese military intelligence. He might be called as a witness for the US House committee probing Hunter Biden and President Joe Biden for possible malfeasance.&nbsp;The present status of Luft’s prospective testimony is unknown, given the DOJ’s announcement of charges against him during Biden’s presidency. According to Luft, he met with FBI investigators in Brussels in 2019 and warned them about President Biden’s family allegedly receiving large sums of money from Chinese authorities.&nbsp;He said that the state-owned Chinese energy corporation CEFC paid Hunter Biden $100,000 per month and Joe’s brother, Jim Biden, $65,000 per month. Luft said that Hunter and Jim took the money in return for their FBI ties and the use of the Biden brand to promote China’s Belt and Road Initiative throughout the world.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiemqRdocKnwIypmKudnqnAbsPHnqmeZZGnsm7Ax56wZp6ipLpussCmoKWxXZrBqbrInKCtsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./albert-desalvo-19310903-html.html><span>←</span><span>Albert DeSalvo (Criminal) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
