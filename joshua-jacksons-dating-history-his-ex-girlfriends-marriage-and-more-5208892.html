While speaking with Rolling Stone at the time, Katie played it coy while talking about a past relationship, which many believed was with Joshua, per <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i>E!</i></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I’m just going to say that I met somebody last year,” she said in 1998. “I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable that I will treasure it always.” After Katie was asked if she was referring to Joshua, she replied, “I feel so fortunate because he’s now one of my best friends. It’s weird. It’s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now. He’s been in the business so long, and he’s really helped me. I respect him as a friend and as a professional.”</p><h2>Brittany Daniel<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/brittany-daniel-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>In 1999, Joshua and his other <i>Dawson’s Creek</i> co-star briefly dated, according to multiple outlets. It’s currently unclear how long he and Brittany dated, but they appeared on the red carpet at the 1999 Radio Music Awards together.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Rosario Dawson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rosario-Dawson-Emmys-2022-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Rosario and Joshua reportedly began dating in 2002 and broke up less than a year later.

We’re both children of divorce, so it’s hard for me to take marriage at face value as the thing that shows you’ve grown up and are committed to another person. But it may change at some point. We may get married.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Alyssa Julya Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/alyssa-julya-smith-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2018, Joshua and Alyssa were briefly linked, but their romance apparently fizzled out by the end of that year after he was spotted with his now-ex-wife, Jodie.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Jodie Turner-Smith<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jodie-turner-smith-divorce-joshua-jackson-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>Joshua and Jodie started dating in late 2018, and they tied the knot one year later.
