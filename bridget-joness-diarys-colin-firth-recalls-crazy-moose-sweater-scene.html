They were lovely, but they just weren’t funny. So eventually we decided it had to be a moose, not a reindeer.”</p><p>Looking back, Firth revealed that he’s not a fan of over-the-top festive sweaters. “I have at times been unfairly blamed for subsequent surges in Christmas sweater sales,” he shared. “For whatever reason, I tend to break a sweat at the sight of them.”</p><p>Firth then confessed, “I never noticed it was a moose.”</p><p>Despite having an uncomfortable shooting experience, Firth reprised his role in 2004’s Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and 2016’s Bridget Jones’s Baby.</p><p>The Oscar winner hasn’t ruled out a fourth installment either, telling <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> in September 2016, “One of the greatest incentives for doing this again was to see Renée in the role again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I enjoy playing Mr. Darcy, but I’m not hungry to play Mark Darcy again. It’s not an ambition,” Firth explained. “But it is something of an ambition to see Renée inhabit that role again, because I think it’s one of the best characters ever created.”</p><p>Zellweger, 54, teased in April 2022 that she does hope to reprise the role once again. “I love being in her shoes,” she said during an interview on SiriusXM’s <a href=# rel=noopener>The Jess Cagle Show</a>. “It makes me giggle every day on set, the choices that we get to make about just how awkward we can make her circumstances. It’s just so much fun.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmroZScsrV5yailnqujYrGqrdGyqmabn6G2r3nFoqmtoF2nsqSty6WqZpuilse6ecyopqydXajEpq3Tnqlmq5Oau6Z7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brazilian-bum-lift-implants-chloe-khan-jemma-lucy-star-delguidice.html><span>←</span><span>What is a bum lift, how much do a set of implants cost and which celebrities have had the procedure?</span></a>
